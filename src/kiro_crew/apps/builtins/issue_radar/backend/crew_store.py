"""Crew records, work items and the append-only event ledger.

One repository's crews live under its repo data dir::

    repos/<owner>/<repo>/crews/settings.json      protocol constants, repo-wide
    repos/<owner>/<repo>/crews/<crew_id>.json     one crew

Those two are operator configuration and are files. The crew's WORK -- its work
items, its progress lines and its passes -- is not: it is a projection of the
crew's own crew log. ``issue_radar_crew_record`` appends one ``radar/recorded``
entry per call to the session log of the slot the crew runs on, and every read of
a work item, a progress line or the repository's shared skip index folds those
entries (the ``radar`` projection in ``kiro_crew.crew_log.projection``). See the
ledger section below for what that buys and what it costs.

Every file carries ``schema``. Issue Radar's usual versioning strategy — a schema
mismatch is a cache miss, refetch from the forge — does NOT transfer here: a crew
record has no upstream to refetch from, so readers coerce forward on read and a
real migration is required if the shape ever changes incompatibly.

Locking. ``store.py``'s per-record lock is the model for the crew record. The
ledger takes no lock of its own: an append to a crew log is serialised by the
crew log's writer, and every invariant the old three-file transaction held under
three locks -- a phase never moves without its logged reason, an issue is never
skipped without being indexed -- is a property of ONE entry instead.

#   TTL_ACTIVE          — only these age toward the claim TTL. A parked pull
#                         request is stronger evidence of a live claim than any
#                         heartbeat could be, and a crew waiting on a human's
#                         review for three days has no progress to record.
#   EDITING             — a worktree with uncommitted changes. At most one per
#                         crew, enforced in `commit_work_progress`.
#
# A crew NEVER holds an issue waiting for a human. When it needs a human decision
# or a human investigation it says so on the issue, labels it, records the pass
# (`skipped`, with a scope naming which of the two it needs) and releases the
# claim — so every non-terminal phase is one the crew is itself the actor in, and
# every one of them occupies a work slot.

#: ``sweep`` is the one kind that does NOT belong to an issue: it records that the

#: protocol with no work item behind it. Every other kind names something done TO

#: Why an issue was passed over, as a closed vocabulary. Two things need it to be

#: what this fleet does not take on, and a human scanning the index wants to see
#: whether the passes cluster on `needs-design` (a backlog problem) or on
#: `not-reproducible` (a triage problem). Free text gives neither.
#:
#: ``needs-decision`` and ``needs-investigation`` are the two that mean "a human
#: has to do the next step". They are scopes on a PASS rather than a state of
#: their own precisely because the crew does not wait for that human: it says what
#: it needs on the issue, labels it with the repo's ``needs_human_label``, records
#: the pass and moves on. The issue is then found again by whoever answers, not
#: held by a crew that cannot proceed.

    Two decoded JSON values reach here that ``int()`` cannot convert, and both are
    reachable from a request body and from a stored file:

    * ``Infinity``/``-Infinity``/``NaN``, which Python's ``json`` accepts by
      default — and which ``1e309`` also produces, by overflowing SILENTLY on the
      way in, so a plain-looking literal is enough. ``int(inf)`` raises
      ``OverflowError`` and ``int(nan)`` raises ``ValueError``, which is a 500 from
      whichever route touched the value rather than the clean refusal the caller
      earned.
    * ``True``/``False``. ``bool`` is a subclass of ``int``, so ``json`` ``true``
      would otherwise store as ``1`` — the same trap ``routes._pr_number_field``
      guards, and for the same reason.

    Non-finite is refused rather than clamped, because there is no defensible
    finite value to clamp it to and a stored ``inf`` is worse than the crash it
    replaces: ``json.dumps`` writes it back as a bare ``Infinity``, which is not
    JSON, so the dashboard's ``JSON.parse`` rejects the whole payload — one poisoned
    crew record takes the Crews page down for every crew in the repo. A comparison
    against it is quieter still: ``open_count >= inf`` is simply ``False`` for every
    count, so a cap expressed that way is defeated without raising anything.

    Returning ``None`` for "not a number" is :func:`_validated_text_setting`'s
    convention — the caller decides whether that means the default, ``None`` on the
    record, or a refusal. A FRACTIONAL float reads as "not a number" too: ``int()``
    truncates, so ``47.9`` would store as ``47`` — a value the operator never
    asked for, silently, with the form reporting success. Truncation is the same
    silent substitution the frontend's ``Number.isInteger`` guard refuses one layer

#
# A crew's work items, its progress lines and its passes are not files of their
# own. Each ``issue_radar_crew_record`` call appends ONE ``radar/recorded`` entry to
# the crew's own crew log -- the session log of the slot the crew runs on -- and
# everything below is a FOLD of those entries: the ``radar`` projection in
# ``kiro_crew.crew_log.projection``. One entry carries the item's delta, the event
# that explains it and, when the phase is ``skipped``, the skip row, so the three
# writes the old store made all-or-nothing under three locks are one append that a
# crash cannot separate.
#
# A crew's slot owns one ACP session id at a time, so its record is spread over a
# unit per id it ran under and the read joins them (:func:`crew_log_units`). The
# repository's shared skip index is the UNION of every crew's folded passes
# (:func:`read_skips`); that is the one read made across crews, and it is a fold
# rather than a second mutable file.
#
# The pre-projection files (``crews/<crew_id>/<n>.json``, ``events.jsonl``,
# ``skipped.json``) are read once more, to be CARRIED into the log on a crew's
# first write after the upgrade (:func:`_carry_legacy_forward`), and never written.

    *events* are this item's lines in TIME order (oldest first). Each contributes a
    ``phase`` only if it carries one — a pre-feature line, or a write that carried
    no phase, simply has no key and is skipped here, which degrades the drawing to
    L0/L1 for that item rather than failing the fold.

    *title_hints* maps issue/PR ``number`` to the issue's REAL title, seeded from
    the issues and pulls list caches (:func:`_fabric_title_hints`). The crew ledger
    stores NO title — a work item carries ``number`` and ``phase``, not what the
    issue is called — so the title has to come from the same list caches Issue
    Radar already keeps, at zero extra API cost. A number with no cached title
    (never fetched, or aged out) folds to ``""`` and the lane shows its id only,
    rather than mislabelling the lane with the crew's resumable ``next`` intent.

    Three things a naive fold gets wrong, each pinned by a test:

    * **The live phase is the record's, authoritative — never the max timeline
      index.** A round-trip through review (``awaiting-ci -> addressing-review ->
      awaiting-ci``) ends LEFT of where it has been, so keying the head off the
      furthest column reached puts the item in a phase it already left. This
      function reads ``phase`` straight off the record and returns it as its own
      field; ``timeline`` is only the history.

    * **Off-spine phases are an ``exit``, not a timeline entry.** ``skipped`` /
      ``yielded`` / ``handed-back`` / ``preempted`` / ``awaiting-reply`` leave the
      spine's topology intact. ``exit`` is the LAST off-spine line seen — but it is
      cleared the moment a later on-spine line reopens the item, so it stands only
      when the item's live phase is itself off-spine. (The record's live phase is
      the tie-breaker: a torn ledger that ends off-spine while the record is on-spine
      still clears the exit.)

    * **Re-entering a phase after an exit is a reopen, and each restarts the dwell
      clock.** ``reopens`` counts an on-spine line landing on an already-visited
      phase while an exit was standing — the store clears ``outcome``/``finished_at``
      on exactly that transition, so it is a real second life, not churn.
