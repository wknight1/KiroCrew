"""Crew HTTP surface — the Crews dashboard page and the crews' own writes.

Registered from ``routes.register_routes`` (one import, one call) rather than by
the app manifest, so this app still has exactly ONE place that lists its routes.
It lives in its own module because ``routes.py`` is already 200KB and the crew
surface is a separate feature with its own store; the shared request plumbing
(``_key_from_request``, ``_str_field``, ``_st``, ``_require_enabled``,
``_pr_action_preamble``, ``_audit``) is imported from ``routes`` rather than
re-derived, because a second copy of a gate is how one of them eventually ships
without the check.

Routes, all under ``/api/apps/issue-radar``:

  GET    /crews?owner&repo          -> {owner,repo,provider,host, crews[], settings,
                                        counts{on_duty,working,paused}}
  POST   /crews                     -> {crew}
  GET    /crews/names?owner&repo    -> {suggestions[]}
  GET    /crew?owner&repo&id        -> {owner,repo,provider,host, crew, items[], events[],
                                        settings, skipped_numbers[], recent_skips[],
                                        counts{open}}
  PUT    /crew                      -> {crew}
  DELETE /crew                      -> {crew}          (retire — the record survives)
  PUT    /crew/work                 -> {item, event, skip}
  POST   /crew/pause                -> {crew}
  GET    /crews/settings?owner&repo -> {settings}
  PUT    /crews/settings            -> {settings}
  POST   /issue/comment             -> {comment_id, url, number}

There is deliberately NO route through which a human answers a crew, and no queue
of items a crew is holding for one. A crew that needs a human decision or a human
investigation says so on the issue, labels it with the repo's
``needs_human_label``, records the pass and releases its claim — so the place that
work waits is the issue tracker the person already reads, not a dashboard-local
inbox that only exists while this app is running.

WRITE-PERMISSION DECISION (the one this module had to make). Two tiers:

  * ``POST /issue/comment`` is a FORGE write and goes through
    ``routes._pr_action_preamble``, which is the existing gate chain used by every
    mutating pull-request route: JSON body -> owner/repo -> connected repo ->
    ``_repo_can_write`` (fail-closed: ``None`` from a transient ``gh`` failure is
    DENIED). Nothing about a crew earns a weaker gate than a human clicking the
    same button.

  * Every LOCAL crew route (crews, crew, work, pause, settings) requires the repo
    to be CONNECTED but **not** writable. Three reasons, in the order they
    mattered:
      1. Precedent: ``_handle_put_investigation`` is the same shape — per-repo
         local state, nothing reaches the forge — and is gated on connected only.
      2. ``_repo_can_write`` FAILS CLOSED, and these writes are how a crew records
         work it has ALREADY done. Gating them on a remote permission read means a
         network blip leaves a crew holding a dirty worktree with no way to persist
         its phase or its reason — losing local truth to an unrelated outage. The
         forge writes it would then attempt are each gated on their own.
      3. A read-only repo is still worth crewing: Issue Radar already degrades to
         suggest-only there, and a crew that investigates and records what it found
         without pushing is a legitimate configuration. Permissions can also be
         granted later without recreating the crew.
    The exposure this accepts is bounded and local: a user who can reach the
    dashboard can create crew records on a repo they cannot write to. Those records
    cannot mutate the repo — the first forge write refuses.

``crew_store.CrewStoreError`` maps to **409**, never 500: every raise is a
user-visible condition (a duplicate crew name, a second item trying to enter an
editing phase). "Unknown crew" is caught earlier and answered 404, because a
missing record is not a conflict.

WHO A CREW IS (the identity decision). Exactly two routes are reachable by an
AGENT — ``GET /crew`` and ``PUT /crew/work``, the pair behind the
``issue_radar_crew_read`` / ``issue_radar_crew_record`` MCP tools. For an agent
caller (loopback + ``X-Internal-Secret``, which the auth middleware marks as
``request["internal_auth"]``), owner, repo and crew id are derived from the
AUTHENTICATED SESSION KEY: ``X-Session-Key`` is matched against the crew record's
``slot_key``. They are never taken from the request. That is the whole security
property — an agent cannot NAME a repo, so it cannot reach a same-numbered issue
in another repo, and it cannot reach another crew's ledger at all (which would
also defeat the store's per-crew "one editing item" invariant). A query or body
that names a DIFFERENT owner/repo/crew is refused **403**, not quietly rewritten:
a cross-crew attempt must fail where someone can see it. The dashboard, which
authenticates with a cookie, keeps passing ``owner``/``repo``/``id`` unchanged.

Every OTHER crew route refuses an internal-secret caller outright — see
``_AGENT_REACHABLE``. This gate lives here and not in the middleware allowlist
because the allowlist cannot express it: ``dashboard.server`` entries are matched
``path == p or path.startswith(p + "/")`` and carry no method, so the ``/crew``
entry admits ``/crew/pause`` as well, and no path-only entry can separate
``GET /crew`` from ``PUT``/``DELETE /crew``. Deny-by-default HERE is what makes
"those two endpoints and only those two" true, including for any route added under
``/crew/`` later.

    THE route a crew writes its progress through, and the one the MCP write tool
    targets. It upserts the work item AND appends one ledger line in a single
    call, which is the whole point: a phase cannot change without a logged reason,
    because there is no route that changes one without the other.

    ``number`` IS OPTIONAL, and omitting it is how a crew records a step that
    belongs to no issue — today only a queue sweep that took nothing. That case
    exists because the alternative was worse: a crew with an empty queue had no
    way to report the cycle except by attributing it to an issue it never touched,
    so the record either lied or was not written at all. A numberless write takes
    the crew-level path below: one ledger line, no work item, no skip entry, and
    no work-item fields accepted.

    ORDER MATTERS and is: validate the log line -> write the item -> index a skip
    -> append the line. Validating the kind and text FIRST means the store's own
    refusals, including the second-editing-item 409, all happen before anything is
    appended. Appending first would be worse: a store refusal would leave the
    ledger asserting a change that never happened, and a lie in an append-only log
    cannot be taken back.

    ORDER IS NOT ENOUGH, though, and the request is ALL-OR-NOTHING: three durable
    writes to three files cannot be made atomic by any permutation, so a later write
    that fails rolls the earlier ones back before the error goes out. That is one
    transaction under one lock, and it lives in ``crew_store.commit_work_progress``
    — the store owns the file layout and the locks, and a rollback whose target
    another writer can move while it is held is a lost update rather than a
    rollback. This route contributes the two things only a request knows: the
    fields to patch, and the prose a pass is recorded with.

    THE SKIP INVARIANT. A patch that sets ``phase`` to ``skipped`` indexes the pass
    repo-wide in the same transaction, so it is not possible to skip an issue
    without indexing it. Nothing in the app writes a phase except through this
    route, and the route cannot write one without handing the store a reason.

    ``skip_scope`` is OPTIONAL and defaults to ``other``. Requiring it would break
    every existing caller of this route for a field that is only a filter label.

    Identity follows the same two-caller rule as ``GET /crew``: an agent's
    ``owner``/``repo``/``crew_id`` come from its session, and a body that names a
    different crew is refused rather than honoured. Without that, everything the
    read leg does to keep a crew inside its own ledger would be undone one route
    later — the write is where the damage would be.
