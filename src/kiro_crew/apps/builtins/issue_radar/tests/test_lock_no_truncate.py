"""issue_radar lock sidecars must be opened WRITABLE but WITHOUT truncation.

Every lock context manager in ``store.py`` and ``crew_store.py`` opens the lock
file and hands the descriptor to ``platform_compat.file_lock(..., exclusive=True)``.
``open(path, "w")`` truncates at open, BEFORE the lock is held. ``msvcrt.locking``
needs a writable handle, so ``"r"`` is not an option either; but on Windows a
truncating open of a lock file whose first byte another holder already locked
raises a sharing violation instead of waiting, so the second contending acquirer
crashes before it ever reaches ``file_lock`` and the critical section is never
mutually excluded. POSIX ``flock`` tolerates the truncate, which is why the
defect is Windows-only.

Truncation is the direct, platform-independent observable, and the work_ledger
suite pins it the same way: seed the lock file with bytes, acquire and release the
lock, and assert the bytes survived. A truncating ``open(path, "w")`` fails these
on every platform (the file is emptied); the ``touch`` + ``"r+"`` open passes, and
that same non-truncating open is what stops the Windows sharing violation.

The cases below cover both modules and all three path expressions in use: a bound
``lock_path`` variable, a ``.with_suffix(".json.lock")`` cache sidecar, and a
per-item ``.lock`` name.
