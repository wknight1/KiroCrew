"""Review executor — one shared, batch-scoped ``AcpRuntime``, one session per task.

Every code review multiplexes onto a SINGLE kiro-cli subprocess (``AcpRuntime``)
rather than a pool of per-worker ``AcpClient`` processes. Design:

  * **One runtime per batch** — lazily ``spawn()``ed on the first task of a batch
    and ``kill()``ed when the batch drains (see ``_BatchRuntimeHolder``). One
    subprocess serves all concurrent reviews; teardown reclaims all memory.
  * **One session per task** — each dispatch (gate / deep / follow-up / post)
    gets its own ``AcpSessionHandle`` (distinct ``sessionId``), ``destroy()``ed on
    completion, so one review never leaks context into another. No process respawn.
    A review asked to stay resumable keeps only its TRANSCRIPT (see
    ``sage_lib/followup.py``); the session itself is terminated like any other.
  * **Bounded concurrency** — a semaphore of width ``review.max_concurrent``
    (default 5, ceiling ``MAX_CONCURRENT_CEIL`` = 30) caps in-flight sessions.
    Because it is a single process, raising concurrency (e.g. to review all open
    PRs) costs sessions, not subprocesses.
  * **Auto-approval + audit** — the reviewer runs the ``gh`` CLI + shell, so each
    tool permission is auto-approved; and because the runtime layer has no
    ``audit_source``, the pool emits its own per-tool SEL audit.

These sessions are created directly on the runtime — NOT via the gateway's
``/api/spawn`` / ``SubagentManager`` path — so they never produce an agent card,
a ``:lock:`` approval prompt, a Slack relay, or a 30-minute reaper slot. The
review runs silently.

The executor is async; the (synchronous, threaded) review driver bridges to it
via ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`` on the gateway event loop, and brackets
each run with ``begin_batch()`` / ``end_batch()``. See ``backend/routes.py``.

    ``AcpRuntime``** multiplexing one ``AcpSessionHandle`` per task.

    Replaces the former pool of ``AcpClient`` subprocesses (one process per
    worker + a full process respawn between CRs). Now a single kiro-cli subprocess
    serves every concurrent review; per-task isolation is a distinct ``sessionId``
    (created + ``destroy()``ed per task, so no context leaks between reviews), and
    the whole runtime is torn down when the batch drains (see ``_BatchRuntimeHolder``).

    Concurrency is a plain semaphore over session-handles (``review.max_concurrent``,
    default 5, ceiling 30) — independent of subprocess count. These sessions are
    created directly on the runtime, NOT via ``/api/spawn``, so they produce no
    agent card, ``:lock:`` prompt, Slack relay, or reaper slot; the review runs
    silently. The runtime layer has no ``audit_source``, so this class emits the
    per-tool SEL audit itself (parity with the old ``AcpClient`` worker).
