"""Registration bridges — wire app resources into KiroCrew's runtime.

When an app is installed or enabled, its agents, skills, and cron jobs need
to be registered with KiroCrew's existing systems.  This module provides
``register_app`` and ``deregister_app`` which handle the namespacing and
symlink/copy operations.

Namespace convention: ``{app_name}/{resource_name}`` to avoid collisions
between apps.

    WHOLESALE, so anything the user had tuned by hand — ``model``, extra
    ``toolsSettings``, a ``description`` — was silently reverted on the next
    gateway start, with no warning and nothing to point at.

    * **Containment** (``managedToolPolicy``, ``includeMcpJson``) is framework-owned
      and always refreshed, because preserving it is wrong in BOTH directions: a
      template that later tightens ``managedToolPolicy.exclude`` would never reach
      an already-enabled install, AND anything that edits that file could drop the
      exclude list — with the old rule the framework then faithfully preserved the
      deletion forever. These are not user preferences to honour; they are the
      reason the app agent cannot reach ``spawn_run``/``cron_*``/``task_run`` or
      inherit the global mcp.json.

    there ships ``python.exe`` and no ``python3.exe``), so the spawn fails with ENOENT and the
    app's MCP tools go silently missing. Plain ``python`` is not a fix either: on Windows
    ``shutil.which("python")`` can resolve a 0-byte Microsoft-Store reparse point — the case
    ``platform_compat._is_windows_store_python_stub`` exists for — and kiro-cli strips env when
    spawning MCP subprocesses, so a PATH lookup can land on an interpreter that cannot import
    ``kiro_crew`` at all. ``mcp_gateway/rewriter.py`` bakes ``sys.executable`` into its stub
    entry for exactly that reason; this is the same decision for app manifests.

    With ``app_root``, the resolution matches what the app's BACKEND launcher already does
    (see :mod:`kiro_crew.apps.interpreter`): the gateway's ``sys.executable`` whenever the
    gateway has provisioned the app's deps dir (``pip install --target`` - those wheels are

    dir through ``PYTHONPATH`` exactly as the backend spawn env does, EXCEPT to a server
    launching a ``kiro_crew`` module, which must never see an app-supplied ``kiro_crew``
    copy. The two spawn paths share one policy on purpose; a second divergent copy is the
    defect this shape removes.

    The rewrite rule, precisely: a BARE name (no path separator) is touched when it is a
    known python launcher OR the app's venv or deps dir provides that exact binary (a pip
    console script - invisible to PATH because neither layout is ever activated). ONE
    path-carrying shape is also rewritten: an absolute script whose shebang names an
    ABI-matched interpreter, which is relaunched through deps_boot under that interpreter
    so its provisioned deps resolve. Every other path-carrying command, a bare PATH
    dependency the app does not provide (``node``, ``npx``, ``docker``), and an HTTP entry
    (no ``command``) was chosen deliberately and is left untouched. Getting this predicate
    wrong breaks working apps, so the boundary is pinned by tests on both sides.

    FAIL-SAFE for ``backend.port:"auto"`` HTTP servers (regression fix):
    a manifest's ``mcpServers.<name>.url`` carries an ILLUSTRATIVE

    a hard error — breaking ALL kiro requests, not just this app's. (An alternate ACP
