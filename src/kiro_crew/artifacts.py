"""Artifacts — persistent identity, versioning, and iteration for LLM-generated UI.

Storage layout
--------------
``~/.kiro/crew/artifacts/<slug>/``
  ``meta.json``        canonical metadata
  ``current.html``     latest rendered content
  ``versions/v1.html`` older versions, never overwritten

The ``slug`` is a URL-safe, human-readable identifier derived from the artifact
name (e.g. ``"CR Queue Dashboard"`` -> ``"cr-queue-dashboard"``). Slugs are the
stable handle the agent uses to iterate on an artifact across sessions.

Each artifact tracks its full version history. ``update()`` writes a new
version under ``versions/`` *and* replaces ``current.html``; older versions are
retained until the configured cap (``MAX_VERSIONS``) is reached, at which
point the oldest are pruned.

Security
~~~~~~~~
- Slugs are validated against ``_SLUG_RE`` to block path-traversal attempts.
- All filesystem writes go through ``Path.resolve()`` + a parent-directory
  check to prevent escapes.
- The sensitive-path fence is queried before any read/write, so the store
  cannot accidentally land under ``~/.aws``, ``~/.ssh``, etc. Off the event
  loop the store's own file helpers hand it the ``realpath`` they already
  computed (``security.is_sensitive_resolved_path()``, see ``_fence_refuses``);
  on the loop, and for the root check and the source-file pointers, the bounded
  ``security.is_sensitive_path()`` answers.
- Tool invocations emit SEL audit events via ``sel().log_tool_invocation()``.

The MCP tools (``artifact_save`` etc.) and HTTP handlers wrap this module --
this file deliberately holds no networking, validation-layer, or rendering
logic.

# ── Constants ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: Maximum number of versions retained per artifact (older versions are pruned
#: when the cap is exceeded).
MAX_VERSIONS = 50

#: Maximum size of an artifact's content blob, in bytes. Locally-authored
#: widget HTML rarely tops a few KB, but cloned/pulled remote artifacts (rich
#: HTML reports, CSVs) routinely exceed 1 MiB — at 1 MiB clone/pull would
#: silently fail on exactly the shared-HTML artifacts bidirectional sync
#: targets. 25 MiB is large enough to bring those down locally while still
#: refusing truly unbounded content. Owned by
#: ``constants.ARTIFACT_MAX_CONTENT_BYTES`` (a leaf) so
#: ``validation.ARTIFACT_CONTENT_MAX`` -- the MCP tool-arg cap -- reads the same
#: name without importing this module; re-exported here for the store's callers.
MAX_CONTENT_BYTES = ARTIFACT_MAX_CONTENT_BYTES

#: Maximum length of human-readable name / description fields.
MAX_NAME_LEN = 200
MAX_DESCRIPTION_LEN = 2_000

#: Maximum length of a file-backed artifact's ``source_path`` / ``source_root``.
#: These are REJECTED past the cap rather than truncated: a truncated path is a
#: different path — usually a nonexistent one — so silently storing it produced
#: an artifact whose live pointer could never resolve, which is precisely the
#: dead-pointer failure ``source_missing`` exists to expose. Comfortably above
#: PATH_MAX on the platforms we support for any realistic project layout.
MAX_SOURCE_PATH_LEN = 512

#: Retention cap for auto-registered widget artifacts (see
#: :mod:`kiro_crew.widget_artifacts`). Every chat-emitted ``<mcwidget>`` becomes
#: an artifact automatically, so without a cap a chat-heavy user accumulates one
#: three-file directory per throwaway widget forever and every library listing
#: is an O(N) scan over them. Past this many, the oldest STILL-UNPINNED
#: auto-registered widgets are deleted; pinning one exempts it permanently. Sized
#: so a long working session's widgets all remain addressable for later
#: iteration while the tail is reclaimed.
MAX_AUTO_WIDGET_ARTIFACTS = 200

#: Allowed kinds (extensible — agents pass plain strings, but a soft allow-list
#: keeps the dashboard's filter UI tractable).
ALLOWED_KINDS = frozenset(
    {
        "widget",  # default — sandboxed HTML/JS via mcwidget
        "html",  # raw html document
        "markdown",  # rendered to widget via MarkdownRenderer

        "image",  # generated image (source_path points to PNG/JPEG)
        "webapp",  # a deployed web application; rendered as an infra control card
    }
)

#: Allowed source markers (provenance).
ALLOWED_SOURCES = frozenset(
    {
        # Provenance/creation buckets (back-compat) + actual session origins from
        # ``infer_use_case`` so an artifact's source can reflect WHERE the saving

        "slack",
        "cli",
        "task-runner",
        "unknown",
    }
)

#: Allowed lifecycle event types. ``referenced`` is reserved for chat-mention
#: scanning (added in a follow-up CR); the in-line save/update path emits
#: ``created`` / ``edited`` / ``iterated`` / ``reverted``.
ALLOWED_EVENT_TYPES = frozenset(
    {"created", "edited", "iterated", "referenced", "reverted", "comment"}
)

#: Max lifecycle events retained per artifact. FIFO eviction keeps meta.json
#: bounded — at ~150 bytes per event entry, this caps each meta file at
#: roughly 75KB on top of the static metadata, which is well within the
#: tolerable read cost.
MAX_EVENTS_PER_ARTIFACT = 500

#: Maximum number of comments retained per artifact (FIFO, like versions/events).
#: ``add_comment`` does load->append->rewrite of the whole comments.json, so an
#: unbounded agent loop (``artifact_post_comment``) would be O(N^2) I/O and grow
#: the sidecar without limit. When the cap is exceeded the OLDEST full thread(s)
#: are dropped (a thread root + its replies together), never a reply orphaned.
MAX_COMMENTS_PER_ARTIFACT = 500

#: Maximum number of tags per artifact. Per-tag length is bounded by ``_TAG_RE``.
MAX_TAGS = 16

# Slug pattern: lowercase letters, digits, hyphens. 1-80 chars. No leading or
# trailing hyphen. Single-character slugs are allowed for trivial names.

    The store's two provenance fields disagree by construction, and neither is

    * ``Artifact.session_key`` is written from the dashboard's BARE slot key —
      ``chat-7-1785396512`` for a dashboard-born tab, ``slack_1785370133.085469``
      for a channel-born one — on the browser create path.
    * an event's ``session_id`` comes from the caller's FULL session key —
      ``dashboard:chat-7-1785396512``, or the channel's own
      ``slack:1785370133.085469`` — because MCP callers resolve identity through
      ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` / the signed pid sidecar, which are
      scope-qualified.

    A literal comparison therefore matches the origin case and *never* the event
    case — the involvement scope would silently degrade to the plain origin
    filter it exists to widen. Each family needs the fold that turns its session
    key into its slot name, because the slot name is what the origin field
    holds:

    * a dashboard slot's name is its session key minus the ``dashboard:`` scope.
    * a channel-born slot's name is its session key run through
      ``history._safe_key`` (see ``channel_slots.channel_slot_name``) — the same
      fold that names the transcript, which is why the tab and the thread share
      one file.

    The namespace itself is never dropped: ``slack:X`` canonicalizes to
    ``slack_X``, never to ``X``, so a channel conversation cannot collide with a
    dashboard slot. Keys with no second spelling to reconcile (``cron:``,
    ``subagent:``, ``taskrunner:``) are returned untouched.

    ``is_sensitive_resolved_path`` (see its docstring), and the store's file
    helpers are pinned to it by ``test_artifacts_pathres.py``.

    Off the event loop -- a ``run_in_executor`` / ``to_thread`` worker, or a
    plain synchronous caller -- the fence is ``is_sensitive_resolved_path``: the
    same decision against the same targets as ``is_sensitive_path``, with no

    hundred artifacts would fill the two-worker pool with resolutions of paths
    this store has already canonicalised; the fail-closed stall then reads as a
    sensitive-path refusal and drops healthy artifacts from the listing.

    On the event loop the bounded ``is_sensitive_path`` stays in place. The
    pre-resolved gate resolves its anchors (``$HOME`` and the override roots)
    inline on the calling thread, and an inline ``realpath`` of a slow or wedged
    root on the loop is exactly the stall the pool's budget exists to prevent

    store's mount, so the helper's own ``realpath`` of the store path does not
    cover them. The probe is the calling thread's, so a caller earns the off-pool

        permanently. Sweeping is for untouched throwaway widgets only.

        Exempt when the artifact:

        * was not auto-registered (an explicit save is never swept);
        * is ``pinned`` — the star is the explicit "keep this" signal;
        * has been filed into a folder (``folder_id``) — filing is curation;
        * has been published/shared (``publication``) — a live URL points at it,
          so deleting it breaks someone else's link;
        * is a fork (``fork_metadata``) — it carries upstream provenance;
        * has been edited at all — the user or the agent iterated on it, which is
          investment even without a star;
        * carries a description or tags — only a deliberate call sets those;
        * has any comment — commenting is unambiguous investment, and comments
          live in a ``comments.json`` sidecar that ``add_comment`` writes WITHOUT
          touching ``meta.json``, so the ``updated_at`` test below cannot see it.

        The edit test is ``updated_at != created_at``, NOT ``version > 1``:
        :meth:`update` only bumps ``version`` when ``snapshot=True``, so a plain
        content save (the common agent-iteration path) leaves the version at 1
        while rewriting the body. Keying on the version would have let the sweep
        delete freshly-iterated widgets. Metadata-only flips (``set_pinned`` /
        ``set_folder``) deliberately do NOT touch ``updated_at``, which is why
        they are checked as separate signals above.

        The library's "New artifact" action creates a document empty and opens it.
        When the user navigates away, one of three things should happen — keep it
        (they invested something), save the draft still sitting in the editor, or
        delete the empty shell they abandoned. This decides which, and acts, in a
        SINGLE lock acquisition.

        That atomicity is the whole point. Deciding client-side means reading the
        artifact, then acting on it, with a window in between — and a save landing
        in that window from a popout window or an agent gets overwritten or
        deleted. No amount of re-reading closes it, because the gap is between the
        read and the write, not inside the read. :meth:`prune_auto_widgets` faces
        the identical hazard and resolves it the same way: re-check and act without
        letting go of the lock.

        "Untouched" means untouched on every axis the record can report:

        * still at version 1 — a snapshot is history worth keeping even if the live
          body was emptied again afterwards;
        * still carrying the caller's untitled placeholder as its name;
        * empty content;
        * no tags, no description;
        * not filed, not starred, not published, not a fork;
        * no ``comments.json`` sidecar. Comments are written WITHOUT touching
          ``meta.json``, so they are invisible to every field above — the same
          reason :meth:`_is_sweepable_auto_widget` stats that file separately.

        The two questions are answered INDEPENDENTLY, and that matters:

        * *Should the draft be written?* Only that the stored content is still
          empty. Nothing else. A document can be renamed, tagged or filed and
          still be holding the user's first paragraph in an editor buffer that was
          never saved — refusing to write it because the name changed loses their
          typing.
        * *Should the shell be deleted?* Only when it is untouched on EVERY axis
          AND there is no draft AND the caller permits it. ``allow_delete=False``
          is how a client says "I have issued writes you may not have applied
          yet": it cannot make deletion safe, but it does not prevent the rescue.

        Returns what it did: ``"saved"`` (``draft`` became the content), ``"kept"``
        (left exactly as it was), or ``"deleted"``.

    * ``name`` — display name (<= 100 chars).
    * ``order`` — sort order among siblings.
    * ``parent_id`` — ``""`` = root; a dangling id is tolerated as root.
    * ``icon`` — optional single-emoji glyph (may be absent).

        # dangling-id handling).

        # published copy in the subtree before calling here and clears each
        # record it withdrew, so an artifact still holding a publication at this
        # point is exactly one that arrived after that preflight -- its copy was

        # take that copy down.

        # The refusal is asked of `delete` itself rather than checked here: a
        # check in this loop is a check-then-act over a snapshot, so a publish
        # landing between it and the delete would still be destroyed. Inside
        # `delete` the check shares the lock with the removal, which is what
        # makes it hold. Phase 1 has already committed the folder-tree change and
        # cannot be rolled back here, so a kept artifact survives with a dangling
        # ``folder_id`` and degrades to Unfiled -- the outcome this path already
        # tolerates, and a recoverable one: the owner restores access to the
        # destination, withdraws the copy, and deletes it deliberately. Note that
