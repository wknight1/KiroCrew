"""Inbound SSH tunnel manager for the Instances feature.

Adapts the supervised-child + state-machine design of
``kiro_crew.tunnel.manager.TunnelManager`` (which points *outward* to expose the
dashboard) to point *inward*: for each connected remote instance it supervises a
local child process that forwards a loopback port to the remote Kiro Crew's
dashboard port, over one of two transports (``Instance.connection_method``):

* ``"ssh"`` (default): ``ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:LP:127.0.0.1:RP <ssh_host>``.
* ``"ssm"``: ``aws ssm start-session --document-name
  AWS-StartPortForwardingSession --target <ssm_target> --parameters
  portNumber=RP,localPortNumber=LP`` — no inbound SSH port or SSH key needed,
  only IAM (``ssm:StartSession``) and the SSM agent on the remote box.

Design note: a literal ``ssh -fN`` would make ssh fork into the background and
the foreground process exit immediately, which would leave the gateway unable to
supervise or kill the real forwarder. A gateway-supervised child must stay in the
foreground, so we use ``-N`` (no remote command) *without* ``-f``, mirroring how
``TunnelManager`` supervises its own child. Connection multiplexing is pinned
off in the argv (``ControlPath=none``) for the same reason: it lets a user's
``~/.ssh/config`` recreate that fork-and-exit shape from outside this module.
``ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`` ensures
ssh exits if the local forward can't be bound, so a failed connect is detected
rather than hanging. The SSM transport gets the equivalent detection from the
generic ready-poll (:meth:`_Tunnel._wait_until_ready`) plus a post-hoc ownership
recheck, since the ``session-manager-plugin`` child does not expose an
``ExitOnForwardFailure``-style flag.

Scope (Phase 1 / Stage 4): connect, disconnect, status, and shutdown-all, with
port allocation + token mint wired in. The health-probe loop and 2-tier
self-heal are Phase 3 — this module exposes clean seams (an ``on_exit`` hook and
a per-instance state machine) for that follow-up without implementing it here.
SSM support reuses every one of those seams — it is a second *transport* plugged
into the same tunnel/state-machine/self-heal/token-refresh code, not a parallel
implementation.

Security (standard practices): loopback-bound forwards only (never ``0.0.0.0``);
child spawned via argv list (no local shell) for both transports; ``ssh_host`` /
``remote_bin`` (SSH) and ``ssm_target`` / ``aws_profile`` / ``aws_region`` (SSM)
injection-validated before use; minted tokens held in memory only and never
logged.

    verification and the first signal in ONE thread keeps the check-to-signal
    window at in-process microseconds, the same residual the repo's other
    pid-reuse guards accept.

    Identity is pid + start time + exact argv, checked in that order, and the
    start-time comparison is RE-RUN before the destructive SIGKILL: the grace
    window is exactly the interval in which the pid can exit and be recycled,
    and ``pid_exists`` polling cannot observe an exit that is immediately
    followed by reuse. Mirrors the stale-app-backend reaper's guard
    (leak-not-mis-kill): any unconfirmed identity withholds the signal.

    ``tree=True`` for the SSM transport, whose child was spawned into its own
    process group (``start_new_session``, so pgid == pid) — the group signal
    reaps the ``session-manager-plugin`` grandchild still holding the
    forwarded port, and completion is judged by :func:`pgroup_exists` plus the
    port actually releasing, so a wrapper that exits first cannot fake
    success while the plugin keeps the port. If the group leader is already
    reaped by SIGKILL time, the group cannot be re-addressed through the
    existing pid-keyed helpers; the TERM broadcast has already reached every
    member, and a member that ignores it keeps the port — reported truthfully

    is spawned WITHOUT a new group: after a gateway hard-kill it sits in the
    DEAD gateway's process group, where a group signal could hit unrelated
    survivors — so it gets a pid-scoped signal only, which suffices because
    ``ssh -N`` holds the forward itself and spawns no descendants of its own.

    Returns one of: ``"reclaimed"`` (identity confirmed, process/group gone,
    port released), ``"identity_mismatch"`` (nothing was ever signalled),
    ``"recycled_during_grace"`` (SIGKILL withheld: the pid stopped matching

        """Reclaim *inst*'s own forwarder child leaked by a gateway hard-kill.

        A SIGKILLed gateway never runs teardown, so its forwarder child
        survives, reparented to init with nothing left to reap it: one idle
        process, one loopback port, and one live session to the remote per
        hard-kill → reconnect cycle. The restarted manager finds the recorded
        ``local_port`` occupied and (correctly) allocates around it; this hook
        is what turns that permanent leak into a reclaim.

        Reclamation is keyed on OUR OWN recorded identity, never a
        process-table match — matching the table by argv pattern would
        SIGTERM forwards operators opened themselves, and no
        pattern can distinguish our child from a stranger's. The registry
        itself is agent-writable, so a recorded claim is honored only when it
        AUTHENTICATES: the record must carry the gateway's own MAC over
        (instance id, pid, start time, port), computed at spawn under a key
        derived from the SEL trust root — which an agent can neither read nor
        replace — so a record written or re-pointed by anything but this
        gateway fails verification outright. Behind the MAC, defense in depth
        from kernel-owned facts: the candidate must be a genuine ORPHAN — not
        a pid this manager currently supervises, and reparented to init
        (``get_ppid == 1``), which no live gateway's forwarder is. Then the
        recorded pid is trusted only behind a STRICT identity check, both
        halves recorded at spawn: the pid's start time must equal the recorded
        ``forwarder_start``, AND its full argv must exactly equal the forward
        command line this manager would construct for the recorded port (host
        and all). Anything less — either hint missing, process gone,
        attributes unreadable, or any element differing — means the identity
        cannot be confirmed: the process is left alone and connect falls
        through to normal allocation. The start-time half is what defeats pid
        recycling (argv can collide in principle; a recycled pid's start time
        cannot), and it is re-verified before the SIGKILL escalation inside
        the worker. Best-effort: a failed reclaim never fails the connect, it
        only leaves the leak for the next attempt.

        A rebuilt-vs-recorded argv can also drift apart without any foul play
        (an edited compression/host setting, or an ``aws`` entrypoint the
        kernel rewrites through a shebang) — that misses the reclaim, never
        mis-kills, and is logged below so the miss is visible instead of
        silent.

        Runs under the manager lock (its caller ``connect`` holds it); every
        blocking step — the port probe and the verify-and-signal worker — is

        Works for either ``connection_method`` — the transport is resolved by

        torn down first (``keep_intent`` — the user is asking for the crew, not
        turning it off) and a fresh forwarder is spawned on a DIFFERENT local
        port: the port just freed is excluded from the allocation, so both a
        stalled stream on the old forwarder and a cause bound to the old port
        itself are escaped by one Retry. This is the pane's Retry after a load watchdog
        fired on a document that DID navigate: the transport is up by every
        probe the manager runs (``/api/health`` answers, the credential
        validates), yet one stream inside it stalled and the pane's module
        graph will wait on it forever. Nothing short of a new TCP path clears
        that, and the plain connect — which sees CONNECTED and returns — would
        hand the same stalled tunnel back.

        A teardown that fails (the stop raises) is reported as an ERROR status,
        the same way every other connect failure is: the live tunnel is left
        exactly as :meth:`_teardown_locked` leaves it (intact — nothing is
        removed unless the stop succeeded), the reason is retained for
        :meth:`last_error`, and the caller gets a 502 with a message instead of
        a propagated exception turned into an unexplained 500.

        ``only_if_connected=True`` is the opposite restriction: answer a
        CONNECTED tunnel exactly like the plain connect (its status, its cached
        token) but, when the tunnel is not up, spawn nothing and touch nothing
        -- return a DISCONNECTED status and leave ``was_connected`` as the user
        last set it. This is the viewport's auto-warm, whose job is to pre-mount
        panes for tunnels that are ALREADY up, never to bring one up. The check
        runs under the manager lock, the same lock :meth:`disconnect` holds
        while it stops a tunnel, so an auto-warm racing a disconnect either sees
        the tunnel still CONNECTED (and warms a pane the disconnect's
        ``removeWarm`` then drops) or sees it gone and stands down; it can never
        re-open a tunnel the user just closed, which a probe-then-connect from

        ``mine.start()`` is an unlocked await, so the world can move between
        the gated install (see :meth:`_rebuild`) and this record: a
        ``connect()`` replaces *mine* (stopping it), or a ``disconnect`` tears
        it down — either way the record this write would make is about a
        tunnel that is not current, and persisting ``was_connected=True`` over
        a disconnect's ``False`` would silently revive, across restarts, an
        instance the user turned off. *expected_epoch* is the Phase 1 stamp
        plus the installs this recovery made itself; teardown bumps the stamp
        too, so any interleaved install OR teardown reads as a mismatch and
        the record is refused. Nothing needs unwinding on refusal: every
        displacing path stops the tunnel it displaces, so *mine* is already
        down and untracked.

        Reset the attempt counter and persist the hints, under lock, iff tracked.

        A rebuild replaced the tunnel child, so the recorded forwarder
        identity (``forwarder_pid`` + ``forwarder_start`` + the
        ``local_port`` that child is bound to) must move with
        ``was_connected`` — a stale identity would point a later hard-kill
        reclaim at a process that does not exist (harmless, the identity
        check refuses it) while the ACTUAL replacement child leaked
        unrecorded. All hints go in one write.

        The record comes from :meth:`_forwarder_identity_hints`, so this write
        carries exactly the fields :meth:`connect`'s does and the pair cannot
        drift apart. ``local_port`` matters twice over here. A rebuild takes
        its port from the LIVE tunnel (see :meth:`_recover`), which may differ
        from the recorded one. And ``forwarder_sig`` is a MAC over the port, so
        recording a pid against a different port than the one it was signed
        with leaves the signature failing verification — the reclaim then
        refuses the very child this write exists to record, and every consumer
        reading the recorded port (the pane URL, :meth:`diagnose`'s fallback)
        addresses a port nothing is listening on.

        The persist stays INSIDE the manager lock so write order equals
        lock-acquisition order: a concurrent :meth:`disconnect`'s
        ``was_connected=False`` (also written under the lock) can never be
        overwritten by this recovery write landing late. The tracked-check
        gates the persist — an instance the user disconnected must not be
        re-marked auto-reconnectable. ``_persist_hint`` keeps the lock held
        until the worker write completes even under cancellation; a cancelled
        bare ``to_thread`` await would NOT stop the already-running thread, so
        its write could land after the lock released and break the ordering.
