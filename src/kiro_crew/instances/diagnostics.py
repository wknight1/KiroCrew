"""Failure-diagnosis ladder for an unhealthy instance tunnel.

When an instance won't connect or self-heal gives up, run a small set of probes
**in dependency order** and report the *first* broken link. That tells the user
the actionable cause instead of a generic "tunnel error":

    1. SSH reachable?            ``ssh <host> true``        → no  ⇒ ssh_unreachable
    2. Remote dashboard up?      ``ssh <host> curl …:RP``   → no  ⇒ remote_down
    3. Local forward reachable?  TCP connect 127.0.0.1:LP   → no  ⇒ tunnel_down
    else                                                          ⇒ ok

All probes are **read-only**, run ``ssh`` via an argv list (no local shell), use
short timeouts, and never surface secrets. ``ssh_host`` is validated before use.
The three probe coroutines are module-level so tests can monkeypatch them.
