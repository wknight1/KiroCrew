"""A live recognition session: PCM in, partial and final transcripts out.

whisper.cpp is not a streaming recogniser. It decodes a buffer, so "live" text
has to be produced by decoding repeatedly as audio arrives, and the only real
question is *what* to re-decode. Decoding the whole utterance every time is the
obvious answer and the wrong one: repeated work grows with the recording and
can fall behind the speaker, especially with large models on CPU runtimes.

So the detector that decides when the utterance ended also decides where to cut
it. On a pause too short to end the utterance, the audio so far is decoded once,
its text is *committed*, and the live buffer resets. A partial is then
``committed text + a decode of the current phrase``, which costs what the current
phrase costs rather than what the whole recording costs, and committed text never
regresses under the speaker.

Those committed decodes are for display only. The **final** transcript is one
decode of the entire buffer, so the text that reaches the user's message box has
the full context the model would have had if it had never been streamed. Partials
are fast and approximate on purpose; the final is accurate.

This module owns no socket and no HTTP. It emits :class:`SttEvent` values and
lets the transport render them, which is what makes a session testable without
one.
