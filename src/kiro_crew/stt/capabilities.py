"""What the installed whisper.cpp build can actually do, read from the build itself.

Separate module, importing neither numpy nor the rest of :mod:`kiro_crew.stt`, for
the same reason :mod:`kiro_crew.stt.limits` is: ``kirocrew doctor`` and the status
endpoint both need this answer, and neither should pull an array library to get it.

**Why a module exists for one string.** The obvious ways to ask "is this build
accelerated" all answer wrongly, in the unsafe direction:

- ``whisper_context_default_params()`` returns ``use_gpu=True`` and
  ``flash_attn=True`` on a CPU-only wheel. Measured on the packaged
  ``pywhispercpp`` for linux-aarch64: both are ``True`` while the build contains no
  GPU backend whatsoever. They are *requests*, honoured only if a backend was
  compiled in, so reading them back is reading our own wish.
- The presence of a GPU on the host says nothing either. The wheels PyPI publishes
  are described upstream as "Basic Pre-built CPU wheels"; CUDA, Vulkan, CoreML and
  OpenBLAS each need a different source build
  (https://github.com/absadiki/pywhispercpp#installation), so an NVIDIA card and a
  CPU-only wheel is the normal case, not an exotic one.
- The model name says nothing: ``large-v3-turbo`` on a CPU build and on a CUDA
  build differ by more than an order of magnitude in decode time.

``whisper_print_system_info()`` is the one value produced BY the compiled artifact,
listing the backends that were actually linked into it. It is therefore the only
honest source, and this module's whole job is to parse it and to refuse to guess
when it cannot be read.

**The section label IS the backend name.** This is the one thing about the format
that is easy to get backwards, and getting it backwards inverts the answer on two
of the three shipped platforms. Upstream builds the string by walking the ggml
backend registry and printing each registry's *name* as a section label, followed
by that registry's own feature flags (``whisper_print_system_info`` in
``src/whisper.cpp``)::

    s += "WHISPER : ";
    s += "VITISAI = "  + ... + " | ";
    s += "COREML = "   + ... + " | ";
    s += "OPENVINO = " + ... + " | ";
    for (i = 0; i < ggml_backend_reg_count(); i++) {
        s += ggml_backend_reg_name(reg);   // "CUDA" / "Vulkan" / "Metal" / "BLAS" / "CPU"
        s += " : ";
        for (; features->name; features++) { s += features->name; ... }
    }

So ``VITISAI``, ``COREML`` and ``OPENVINO`` are the ONLY genuine ``KEY = VALUE``
backend flags. Every other backend appears solely as a label, and its features are
named something else entirely -- CUDA's are ``ARCHS``, ``USE_GRAPHS``,
``FORCE_MMQ``. There is no ``CUDA = 1`` token in any build's output.

Two real captures, both from reviewers on the hosts in question rather than
synthesized here. Stock CPU wheel on Windows Server 2025 x64::

    WHISPER : COREML = 0 | OPENVINO = 0 | CPU : SSE3 = 1 | SSSE3 = 1 | AVX = 1 |
    AVX2 = 1 | F16C = 1 | FMA = 1 | OPENMP = 1 | REPACK = 1 |

The same wheel on macOS arm64 (Apple M5 Pro), which links Metal and Apple's BLAS::

    WHISPER : COREML = 0 | OPENVINO = 0 | MTL : EMBED_LIBRARY = 1 | CPU : NEON = 1 |
    ARM_FMA = 1 | FP16_VA = 1 | DOTPROD = 1 | ACCELERATE = 1 | REPACK = 1 |

Note ``MTL`` rather than ``Metal``, and note that Apple's BLAS is a CPU-registry
feature (``ACCELERATE``) rather than a ``BLAS :`` section. Both are why label
matching is a table of accepted spellings and not a title-case guess.

A caveat this module cannot fix: the string is COMPILE-TIME information. Which
backend a load actually *uses* is stated only by the loader's own
``using <name> backend`` lines, reachable through ``whisper_log_set`` during a
load. This is the honest answer to "what was linked", not to "what ran".
