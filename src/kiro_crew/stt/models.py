"""The whisper.cpp model catalog, and a sha256-pinned downloader for it.

Speech recognition needs weights, and shipping them in the wheel is not an
option: the smallest useful one is 148 MB. So the first use of voice input
fetches one model, once, and every later session loads it from disk.

**The sha256 pin is the trust anchor, and not only for the network fetch.** A
model is written to its final path only after the digest computed while streaming
matches the pinned one, so a tampered mirror, a truncated transfer or a
captive-portal HTML body can only fail verification.

A file ALREADY on disk is verified too, on every load (see
``ModelStore._verified_on_disk``), because provenance is not enough: a same-size
file dropped over the weights would otherwise be trusted forever. Not cached
against the file's metadata either -- ``os.utime`` is available to anything that can
write the file, so a size-and-mtime memo is forgeable by the same actor it is meant
to catch.

The digest is the second line, not the first. Verifying and then handing a PATH to a
native loader leaves a window in which the bytes can be swapped, and re-hashing
cannot close it because the loader re-opens by name. What closes it is that
``<data home>/models`` is WRITE-PROTECTED from the agent
(``security._WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS`` for the file tools; the agent's shell is
confined by the OS sandbox, not by a matcher over command text), so the verified
bytes are the loaded bytes. Adding a row to :data:`CATALOG` therefore needs no edit
in ``security``: the directory entry covers any file beneath it. Kiro Crew's own
downloader writes here directly and does not route through the tool gate, so a
first-run fetch and a re-download after a failed check both still work. That is a
deliberate divergence from ``embeddings.ModelDownloadManager``, which documents the
same size-only trade for its own GGUF -- that reasoning weighed a corrupted
download, not a writable directory and an agent with a shell.

This deliberately does not reuse that manager. It is bound to one pinned
artifact through ``default_model_path()``, ``_GGUF_SHA256`` and the
``memory.embed_model_path`` custom-model escape hatch, so sharing it would mean
generalising the memory subsystem's download path to carry a catalog. The shape,
the doctrine and the ``KIROCREW_SKIP_MODEL_DOWNLOAD`` escape hatch are mirrored
instead, which keeps the two subsystems independent.

Digests here were obtained by downloading each file and hashing it, not by
trusting an upstream header: HuggingFace's ``X-Linked-Etag`` for these objects is
not the content digest. Two of them (``base``, ``small``) independently match the
digests kiro-cli pins for the same models, which is a second source on the same
bytes.

        `is_present` deliberately tests only the size: it answers "must this be
        downloaded", and it is on the path of a UI poll. But size alone is not a
        trust check, and the models directory is fenced by nothing -- neither
        `is_sensitive_path` nor `is_sensitive_write_path` covers it, and a plain
        ``cp`` over the weights is an allowed bash command. So an agent could replace
        them with a same-size file and every later session would transcribe the user's
        speech through weights of its choosing, persistently and with nothing to show
        it had happened.

        Verified on EVERY call, with no metadata cache. A first version memoised the
        result against the file's size and mtime, which does not hold: `os.utime` is
        available to anything that can write the file, so a same-size overwrite with a
        restored mtime satisfied the memo and the next load trusted it. Anything cheap
        enough to check is also cheap enough to forge.

        Affordable because `WhisperEngine.ensure_loaded` decides residency BEFORE
        asking the store, so this runs once per model LOAD rather than once per
        session. That is also precisely when an unverified file would take effect: a
        resident model is already loaded from bytes that passed, and the next thing
        that could load different ones is the next load.

        A file that fails is deleted, so the caller's download path replaces it rather
        than reporting voice as broken.

        Deliberately diverging from `embeddings`, which documents the same size-only
        trade for its own GGUF. That reasoning ("a sha256 over ~600MB on every boot
        buys almost nothing") weighed a corrupted download, not a writable directory
        and an agent with a shell.
