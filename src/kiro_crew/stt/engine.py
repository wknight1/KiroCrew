"""A resident whisper.cpp recogniser, loaded once and reused.

Holding one loaded model in the gateway removes repeated process, interpreter
and model-load costs. Inference latency still depends on the model, hardware and
the acceleration compiled into the runtime: a large model on a CPU-only wheel
can remain slower than real time after warming, even on a host with a GPU.

Three properties make it safe to do this in the gateway process rather than in a
worker of its own:

- **whisper.cpp releases the GIL for the duration of a decode.** A spinner thread
  measured 44.2M iterations/s during a decode against 61.0M/s idle, so the event
  loop keeps running while inference is in flight, so a worker thread is enough.
  Decodes run on ``executors.stt_executor()`` rather than the default pool: a
  started ``run_in_executor`` future cannot be cancelled, so a wedged model load
  would otherwise hold a general-purpose worker for the life of the process. What
  is NOT needed is the dedicated inference thread and priority queue
  ``embeddings.py`` carries, because every request here is interactive: there is
  no bulk class that could starve one.
- **It writes nothing to stdout.** ``print_progress=False`` and
  ``print_realtime=False`` suppress the progress writers; with both set, a load and
  a decode were measured to emit zero bytes on stdout. That matters because this
  module is imported by the MCP servers, whose stdout IS their protocol, and the
  vendored llama.cpp runtime has the opposite behaviour (it ``dup2``s over fd 1
  during model load).

  ``redirect_whispercpp_logs_to`` is deliberately left at its ``False`` default and
  must NOT be set to ``None``, which is the opposite of what the name suggests. It
  is not a log-callback switch and has nothing to do with stdout: passing ``None``
  makes the binding ``os.dup2`` ``/dev/null`` over **fd 2** for the duration of the
  model load, which is process-wide and therefore silences every other thread too.
  Measured across one load: 693 of 862 concurrent stderr writes destroyed, against
  zero at the default, with stdout clean either way. Losing the gateway's logs for
  the 7.4 s of a cold load costs more than the handful of whisper.cpp info lines
  the default lets through -- and those go to stderr, where diagnostics belong.
- **The context is single-entry.** ``whisper_full`` mutates state on the context,
  so two concurrent decodes on one context corrupt each other. Every decode holds
  ``_decode_lock``; a partial that is superseded aborts instead of queueing.

The recogniser package is an optional extra, imported lazily, so a gateway
without it starts normally and reports voice as unavailable with a reason.

        request arrives, so a slow partial can never delay the final decode
        behind it.

        ``abort_if`` lets a session invalidate its own cosmetic decode when the
        client stops or disconnects. Only superseding decodes honor it; final
        recognition always keeps the queued audio and completes independently.

        ``expect`` is the key the caller prepared, and passing it is how a caller
        avoids silently transcribing with someone else's model. This engine is a
        process singleton, so a second session whose configuration names a
        different model or language replaces the resident context, and a decode
        that did not check would return text from the wrong weights or the wrong
        language with nothing to show it had happened. On a mismatch the decode
        refuses and says so, which the caller answers by preparing again.

        ``expire`` semantics are unchanged; ``kind`` only labels the resulting
        :class:`~kiro_crew.stt.telemetry.DecodeSample` so a diagnostic can tell a
        cosmetic partial's cost apart from the final the user waits on. It never
        changes what is decoded.
