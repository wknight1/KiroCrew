# --- extending the MCP binary search path -------------------------------------
#
# ``_EXTRA_PATH_DIRS`` above is a fixed set of guesses and can never be
# complete: WHICH directory a package manager drops an MCP launcher into is
# ecosystem-, distribution- and site-specific. A launcher installed outside that
# list is invisible to every consumer of :func:`augmented_path` — the MCP probe,
# the agent-config command resolver, and gatewayd's rewriter — so a server
# declared by bare name never launches and the session simply comes up short of
# tools, which reads as a missing capability rather than a launch failure.
#
# So the list is extensible from two sides, merged in :func:`mcp_search_path`.
# Fixing it at that one function is deliberate: it is the path all three of those
# consumers resolve against, so one contributed directory reaches all of them
# without any of them knowing it exists.
#
# * ``mcp.extra_path_dirs`` in the config — an operator on one host.
# * :func:`register_mcp_path_dirs` — a packaged/downstream build or an embedding
#   runtime, which has no per-user config file to edit.
#
# Both go through the same absolute-only :func:`_validated_bin_dir` gate as this
# module's own entries, and both rank ahead of :func:`augmented_path`'s guesses:
# a directory somebody named explicitly is more specific than a built-in guess,
# so it must win when the same command name exists in both. A spec's own
# ``env.PATH`` still outranks everything -- an operator pin cannot be displaced.
#
# The contribution reaches ONLY the resolution path, never
# :func:`spec_env_path` (whose result :func:`emit_env` persists into consumed
# config files) and never :func:`augmented_path` (the generic composition). Both
# exclusions are load-bearing and are argued at :func:`mcp_search_path`.
#
# The config value is PUSHED here by the loader (:func:`publish_config_path_dirs`,
# called from ``KiroCrewConfig.load``) rather than read here. That is not
# indirection for its own sake: :func:`mcp_search_path` is reached from the event
# loop by every MCP probe (``probe_server``) and by the agent-config resolver, so
# pulling the config here would stat/read/validate ``config.json`` on the loop.
# Pushing keeps this module's whole search-path construction free of IO, and
# costs nothing: every process that spawns an MCP server loads the config at
# startup, and each later ``load()`` refreshes the snapshot, so an edited setting

    A spec's ``env`` is applied per key by whatever spawns the server, so
    declaring ``PATH`` REPLACES the inherited one for that child instead of
    extending it. This module's own backend spawn takes that shape
    (``mcp_gateway.gatewayd`` builds its child env as ``dict(env)`` then
    ``update(declared)``), and the pptx-maker engine already composes a
    COMPLETE ``PATH`` into its spec's ``env`` for the same reason -- see
    ``pptx_maker.backend.provision.mcp_tools_path``, whose docstring notes that
    nothing the gateway does to its own subprocesses reaches a server the agent
    CLI spawns.

    So a spec that names one directory to add -- a Node version manager's shim
    dir, say -- hands the server a PATH holding *only* that directory, and
    anything the server resolves at runtime disappears. The failure is silent
    and asymmetric: a launcher that is itself a wrapper (``exec
    <sibling-binary> ...``) dies with "not found" for a binary that is plainly
    installed, while the dashboard probe -- which merged rather than replaced --
    reports the same server healthy. Nothing in the UI can distinguish that from
    a working server.

    Expanding the value before it is written into the agent config closes the
    gap: the child is launched with the PATH the probe validates and the command
    resolves against, so "probes healthy" and "works in a session" cannot
    diverge.     The spec's own entries stay FIRST, ahead of both the inherited PATH
    and the augmentation, so a spec that pins a toolchain still wins.

    Idempotent: re-expanding an already-expanded value contributes only
    duplicates, which :func:`dedup_path` collapses. That matters because the
    agent config is rewritten on every gateway start.

    The result is a SNAPSHOT of the rebuild-time environment, so it names this
    host's directories (the mise data dir, each installed Node version's bin,
    the running interpreter's bin) and two starts can legitimately differ if the
    host's own PATH or installed toolchains changed. That is the cost of the
    only lever available for a child this process does not spawn: the config
    handed to the spawner. A config carrying an expanded value is therefore not
    portable to another machine, and the emitted PATH is long enough that
    reading it by eye is unpleasant.

    A non-string value degrades to no override rather than raising. This runs
    once per candidate for every server on every rebuild, so a single
    malformed ``env.PATH`` in any config file would otherwise turn one bad
    entry into a failed gateway start.

    Only for a spec that already declares ``env.PATH``: one that does not
    inherits a usable PATH untouched, so it is left alone and keeps a config
    that stays portable.

# that goes on to establish confinement — so they run before any sandbox exists:
#
# * ``LD_*`` / ``DYLD_*`` are dynamic-loader channels honoured by every
#   ELF/Mach-O binary in the spawn chain, the sandbox wrapper included.
# * The ``PYTHON`` namespace matters because Kiro Crew's Linux sandbox launcher
#   IS a Python process: ``sandbox.namespace_argv`` returns
#   ``[sys.executable, "-I", "-S", <generated script>, *argv]`` (sandbox.py), and
#   that interpreter starts with the env we hand ``Popen``. A declared
#   ``PYTHONPATH`` carrying ``sitecustomize.py`` — or a shadowing ``os.py`` —
#   would be imported at interpreter startup, i.e. before ``unshare`` and before
#   the target is exec'd. ``PYTHONSTARTUP``/``PYTHONHOME`` are the same channel.
#   ``PYTHONUSERBASE`` is too: it relocates user-site, whose ``.pth`` files are
#   EXECUTED during startup.
#
# NOTE the ``PYTHON`` entry covers that whole namespace by prefix, but this is
# still a PREFIX set rather than a general glob: it does not cover ``HOME``,
# which also derives the user-site path when ``PYTHONUSERBASE`` is unset, and
# stripping ``HOME`` from a spec overlay would break servers that legitimately
# need it. The launcher's ``-I -S`` is what
# actually closes that class (site processing never happens, so no ``.pth`` runs
# whatever the paths point at); these prefixes are defense in depth for it and the
# primary control for any future launcher that forgets those flags.
#
# ``PYTHON`` is denied as a NAMESPACE, not as a list of the dangerous names in
# it, for the same reason ``KIROCREW_`` is below: an enumeration cannot cover the
# variable nobody has added yet. ``python3 --help-env`` documents 29 ``PYTHON*``
# variables on 3.12 alone, plus platform-only spellings like
# ``PYTHONEXECUTABLE``, and several are execution channels rather than
# preferences -- ``PYTHONPATH`` places a ``sitecustomize`` module,
# ``PYTHONSTARTUP`` names a file, ``PYTHONBREAKPOINT`` takes a dotted callable
# and imports it, ``PYTHONWARNINGS`` resolves a dotted filter category through
# ``warnings._getcategory``'s ``__import__``, ``PYTHONHOME`` and
# ``PYTHONPLATLIBDIR`` move where the standard library is found. Naming them
# one at a time was tried and did not converge: this set reached six entries by
# accretion while 23 documented siblings stayed open.
#
# The cost is a benign ``PYTHON*`` variable in a spec being refused --
# ``PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`` on a user's own Python MCP server is the realistic
# example. That is a logged refusal rather than a broken server (see the
# asymmetry note below), and ``denied_spec_env_keys`` names the key so the probe
# explains itself instead of reading as a bug. Every first-party ``PYTHON*`` use
# in this tree sets the variable directly on a child process rather than
# declaring it in a spec ``env``, so none of them route through here.
#
# Prefix-matched, case-insensitively (Windows env is case-insensitive).
#
# KNOWN ASYMMETRY, accepted deliberately: ``emit_env`` does NOT strip these, so
# a kiro-cli session still receives a declared ``PYTHONPATH`` — kiro-cli spawns
# the server itself and no Python launcher of ours is in that chain. A Python
# MCP server configured through ``env.PYTHONPATH`` therefore works in a session
# while its PROBE reports an error, which is a visible, logged inconsistency
# rather than a silent one (each dropped key warns). Closing it properly means
# teaching the launcher to apply child env AFTER confinement, which belongs to
# the sandbox module; letting the variable into the launcher instead would trade
# a reporting inconsistency for arbitrary unsandboxed execution.

# prefixes above — not a variant of them. Several ``KIROCREW_*`` variables are
# how the gateway tells a process it spawns WHO IS CALLING, and the consumers
# treat them as vouched-for:
#
# * ``KIROCREW_CLI`` — no consumer reads it. It is covered because the deny is on
#   the NAMESPACE rather than on a list of keys, which is the same property that
#   covers the next identity variable somebody adds.
# * ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` / ``KIROCREW_HOST_PID`` — two of the three sources
#   ``mcp_core._resolve_session_key_strict()`` accepts, chosen precisely because
#   they are, in its own words, sources "the gateway authors and an agent cannot
#   write". A spec overlay authoring one makes that claim false, which is worse
#   than the loader class: it corrupts the resolver the ownership checks are
#   built on rather than the process that hosts them. These two are the live
#   reason this boundary exists.
# * ``KIROCREW_OWNER_ID`` / ``KIROCREW_INTERNAL_SECRET`` — the Slack owner
#   identity and the loopback shared secret. ``cron_script`` already denies these
#   two on its own path; putting them here extends the same control to the probe,
#   which had no such deny.
#
# Denying the NAMESPACE rather than those five keys is deliberate. Dozens of
# ``KIROCREW_*`` variables are read across the tree today, several of them
# security-relevant beyond identity (sandbox level, approval mode, admission
# policy), and a key-by-key list fails open for the next one somebody adds —
# the reviewable property we want is "a config cannot author our namespace",
# which a prefix states and a list only approximates.
#
# Nothing legitimately needs the namespace in a spec overlay. Every caller of
# this sanitizer builds its child env from ``os.environ`` FIRST and overlays the
# spec on top (``cron_script._clean_cron_env()``, ``mcp_discovery``'s
# ``dict(os.environ)``), so a gateway-authored ``KIROCREW_*`` value is INHERITED
# either way. Denying it here removes only a config file's ability to OVERRIDE

    """Drop loader-injection and reserved-namespace keys from a spec env.

    For paths that let a config-declared ``env`` reach a child process. Two
    shapes qualify and both are covered: a spawn path that launches the child
    ITSELF (the probe), and a path that EMITS the env into an agent spec for
    ``kiro-cli`` to launch from (``agent._enforce_managed_mcp_ownership``, for
    a managed server's entry merged out of the agent-writable
    ``agent.json``). The launcher's identity does not change the argument --
    what matters is that config-file text becomes a child's environment.

    That second caller does NOT disturb the ``emit_env`` asymmetry noted above.
    The asymmetry protects a USER'S OWN Python MCP server, which may
    legitimately be configured through ``env.PYTHONPATH``; the managed
    population is ours, its ``command``/``args`` are ours, and it runs as the
    entry point holding the internal API secret, so no declared loader or
    namespace variable on it is legitimate in the first place.

    The declared env is config-file
    text -- the same trust level as the command itself, which those paths
    already refuse to run unsandboxed -- so a key that executes code in the
    launcher before confinement is established must not pass through.

    Two independent classes are dropped, for two different reasons:

    * ``_SPEC_ENV_DENIED_PREFIXES`` — loader/interpreter channels that execute
      code in the launcher before confinement exists.
    * ``_SPEC_ENV_RESERVED_PREFIXES`` — Kiro Crew's own namespace, which carries
      the caller identity our authorization checks read. Sandboxing does not
      mitigate this one at all: confinement bounds what the child may touch, not
      whose jobs Kiro Crew believes the child is entitled to. That is why "the
      command is equally config-authored, and it runs sandboxed" does not settle
      this class the way it settles the command itself. This prefix set is depth,
      not the authorization control, and it cannot be: it stops the ``env`` block
      from spelling an identity key, while the same config's ``command`` field
      reaches the identical consumer (``sh -c 'KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY=... exec
      ...'``). The control belongs at the CONSUMER, which must not grant
      authority from ambient environment at all. Keep this set regardless:
      ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` / ``KIROCREW_HOST_PID`` have legitimate producers,
      so for them the consumer-side answer is a strict resolver, and this prefix
      keeps a config out of the overlay it reads.

    Matching is case-INSENSITIVE on purpose: Windows environment variables
    are case-insensitive, so ``pythonpath`` reaches Python exactly like
    ``PYTHONPATH`` there. On POSIX a lowercase spelling is inert, and
    dropping it anyway costs a benign oddly-named variable at most — the
    asymmetry (fail closed everywhere vs. bypass on one OS) decides it.

    policy, not by accident, and silence would read as the credential-drop

    sidecar. Each of those spawners applies a declared ``env`` per key, so a
    declared ``PATH`` replaces the child's inherited one — the same premise
    :func:`spec_env_path` documents. Routing every writer through one function
    is what keeps the surfaces from diverging: a writer that forgets to expand
    is a server that starts under the probe and dies in a session.

    Returns a NEW dict; the caller's env (typically a source config's own
    object reached through a shallow copy) is never mutated through. The
    ``PATH`` branches, exhaustively: a STRING — empty included — is expanded
    via :func:`spec_env_path`, because that is exactly what the probe and the

    verbatim: rewriting a malformed value would hide the config error behind
    a working-looking PATH, and the consumer's own rejection is the honest
    surface for it. Every other key passes through untouched.

    The PATH key is found case-insensitively (see :func:`spec_path_key`) and the

    while the probe pinned the real one — the divergence this whole path
    exists to close, reintroduced by spelling. On Windows the two names are the

    The gateway is a long-lived, non-login process.  On AL2023 the default
    ``krb5.conf`` uses ``KEYRING:persistent:<uid>`` for the ccache, and kernel
    keyrings are session-scoped — they are NOT visible to subprocesses spawned
    by a background daemon.  So a child (kiro-cli / claude / a pooled MCP
    backend) inheriting ``os.environ`` sees no usable ticket, and Kerberos-gated
    MCP servers (e.g. an SSO-backed MCP server) fail with
    "no Kerberos ticket" even though ``kinit`` succeeded in the user's shell.

    This mirrors :func:`_resolve_ssh_auth_sock` in ``acp.client``: repair the
    credential pointer at spawn time rather than trusting the daemon's stale
    env.  Resolution rules:

    * If ``KRB5CCNAME`` already names a non-default scheme (``FILE:`` operator
      override, or a platform-native ``KCM:`` / ``DIR:`` / ``API:`` cache),
      leave it — the caller already has a working, non-keyring ccache.
    * Only act on Linux: the ``/tmp/krb5cc_<uid>`` workaround targets the
      AL2023 ``KEYRING:persistent`` default.  On macOS the default is the
      ``KCM:`` daemon, so blindly pointing at a stale ``/tmp`` file (e.g. left
      by a prior Linux session or container mount) would hijack a working
      ccache — gate the whole thing on ``sys.platform == "linux"``.
    * Else, if ``/tmp/krb5cc_<uid>`` resolves to a regular file we own, point
      at it.
    * Else, do nothing — no ticket to find; let the MCP surface its own
      auth error rather than masking it.

    The candidate lives in ``/tmp`` (world-writable, sticky-bit), so we ``lstat``
    it first and require ownership by the current uid.  We do NOT reject a
    uid-owned symlink: sssd-krb5 / systemd-pam-krb5 legitimately ship
    ``/tmp/krb5cc_<uid>`` as a symlink into ``/run/user/<uid>/krb5cc/...`` — the
    exact keyring-default distros this fix targets.  For a uid-owned symlink we
    follow it (``os.stat``) and require the *resolved* target to be a regular
    file owned by the current uid.  A symlink or file owned by anyone else is
    rejected, which preserves the co-tenant defense (a foreign user cannot plant
    ``/tmp/krb5cc_<victim_uid>`` and have us trust it).

    ``KRB5CCNAME`` is intentionally absent from the MCP-gateway scrub list
