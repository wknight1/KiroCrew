"""The app-scoped tools reachable only through this server's credential tools: what they advertise and what they do.

``schemas()`` returns the ADVERTISEMENT half of each tool -- its name, the
model-facing description, and the JSON Schema a call is validated against.
``HANDLERS`` maps each of those names to the function that runs it. Both halves
of a tool live here so its contract and its behavior are read together, and
``test_mcp_tool_registry`` fails if one arrives without the other.

Handlers reach this server's shared plumbing as attributes of ``mcp_core`` --
``mcp_core._post``, the identity resolvers, the governance vets. That is
deliberate rather than untidy: an attribute lookup resolves at CALL time, so a
test that rebinds one on the module still intercepts the handler. Importing
those names directly here would bind them at import time and silently escape
every existing patch site.
