#:   folder more narrowly than the sender deletes the arriving documents.

#:   not hold those slugs (any second machine, any restore) therefore loses them on the

#   pass on every scan, which is the cost the mtime/hash gate exists to avoid.
#   The pre-ingest duplicate gate is in the same domain for the same reason: it
#   also runs before extraction.
# * ``items.content_hash`` is sha256 over the EXTRACTED TEXT.
#
# For .md/.txt the two coincide, so a cross-domain comparison appears to work.
# For anything the reader transforms -- PDF, DOCX, HTML -- they differ and the
# comparison silently matches nothing, which is how ownership bookkeeping came to
# be inert for exactly those documents. Folder rows therefore carry the text hash

        # pass, nothing would correct it. Not promoting costs at most ONE sync
        # attempt: ``_record_failure`` reads ``consecutive_failures`` from the
        # blob, which such a row already has at or above its threshold, so the
        # first attempt that fails writes the column and quiesces the source for
        # good -- while an attempt that SUCCEEDS is the right outcome for a source
        # that had recovered. The column is authoritative; a value that cannot be
        # ordered against it does not get to overrule it.
        #
        # The copy is then RETIRED. This runs on EVERY open, so leaving the key in
        # place would make the repair above a standing reader of a value that goes
        # stale the moment a column-only writer moves the row. Retiring makes it a
        # one-time repair instead.
        #
        # The repair is compare-and-set on the row as READ -- the blob AND the
        # column -- so a concurrent writer wins and the row is converged by the
        # next open instead. The retirement predicates on the blob ALONE, which
        # is the only field it writes: a column-only transition is what every
        # live writer does, and requiring the column to be unmoved would abandon
        # the copy for exactly the transitions that are expected to happen.
        # No SQL prefilter on the blob text. A raw substring match cannot decide

        off for the duration; this method itself sweeps every row it finds.

        A caller that looks up an existing source and ingests into it later
        holds ``pipeline.ingestion_in_flight()`` across the whole span, so the
        sweep waits for it rather than racing it.

        Thread-safe by the same rules as every other write path: the calling
        thread gets its own connection through :attr:`db`, and the sweep runs
        as a series of short ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transactions (see the body). Because it may now run after a reader
        has materialised the graph, it refreshes the in-memory graph when one is

        A HARD KILL during an agent-document ingest is still open: the item

        commits on an autocommit connection, so a process killed between the
        item commit and the row commit leaves committed items that no row names.
        The replacement path keys off that row, so the next add of the same
        document adds a second copy instead of replacing the first -- the
        duplicate this sweep repairs. Nothing else on the agent path reaps that
        residue, so it is permanent until this sweep removes it.

        REAPS ONLY ON POSITIVE EVIDENCE, NEVER BY ABSENCE OF A ROW. "No row
        names this item" is NOT proof of crash residue: ``_import_bundle_state``
        has several paths that leave a bundle's agent items unowned on purpose --
        a row skipped as ``ownership_row_key_held_locally``, an empty or
        over-claiming group, a bundle with no state tables -- and a single-item
        export/import round trip (``export_item`` writes no state row) does the
        same. A sweep keyed on absence would silently and unrecoverably delete
        every such imported item. So the ingest records an intent marker in
        ``agent_ingest_intent`` BEFORE it commits items and deletes it on
        finalize; a marker that survives into a drained maintenance window is
        the positive proof that an ingest started and never finished. This sweep
        deletes an unowned ``active`` agent item ONLY when its ``content_hash``
        matches an intent marker -- the hash the crashed ingest stamped on every
        chunk it wrote (``items.content_hash`` over the newline-normalized
        extracted text, the same value the ingest records on the marker). An
        imported item has no such marker for its hash, so it is never a
        candidate. The marker sits in its own table rather than on the ownership
        row, so it covers a crash while REPLACING a live group as well as a
        first add, and two interrupted attempts at one slug each keep their own
        evidence. A reaped attempt's marker is deleted in the same transaction.

        SCOPED TO THE ``agent://`` SOURCE ALONE: only the agent path writes these
        markers, so the sweep cannot reach a folder- or artifact-backed item.

        An item another source also holds (a dedup co-location) is DETACHED, not
        destroyed: ``delete_items_batch_in_txn`` with ``owner_source_id`` moves
        ownership to a surviving holder and drops only the agent source's
        location row. Only an item no other source holds is removed outright.

        Runs off the boot path inside ``maintenance_window`` like
        :meth:`reclaim_orphans`: that waits for in-flight ingestion to drain and
        holds new ingestion off, so an item still mid-ingest -- its marker not

        from a worker thread via ``asyncio.to_thread``. Deliberately NOT called

        work is proportional to ``entities`` + ``entity_relations``, so doing it
        there stalls the gateway before the socket binds.

        **The offload is load-bearing, not hygiene.** Both handlers are
        ``async def`` and read the graph on the loop, where the loop-stall
        watchdog IS armed (it is started after the bind). Reaching this lazily

        mutation-refresh sites acquire no lock of their own, so a first graph GET
        racing a source DELETE put two threads through the rebuild at once, and
        the loser's rows survived into a graph whose ``_graph_loaded`` was then
        set True -- a flag asserting "loaded" over data that is wrong, which is
        worse than an unloaded graph because it never gets rescanned.

        Serializing the whole rebuild also fixes WHICH snapshot wins: the SELECTs
        below run after acquisition, so the rebuild that acquires last reads the
        freshest committed state rather than replaying rows it captured earlier.

        ``self._graph`` between the ``clear()`` and the last insert would see a torn
        (empty or truncated) graph, and a multi-step reader that re-read
        ``self.graph`` across its own steps -- degree ranking, then per-node
        attribute reads -- could miss a node that ``clear()`` had just removed.
        Building into a NEW ``SimpleDiGraph`` and swapping the reference
        under the lock closes that window: the old object is never mutated, so a
        reader holding it sees a complete, consistent OLD graph until it drops the
        reference, and the next read sees the complete NEW one. The multi-step
        readers pin one reference for the duration of their read (see
        ``get_entity_subgraph`` / ``get_neighbors`` and the graph handlers) so a
        swap mid-read cannot mix old and new nodes.

        The lock is only ever taken here and in :meth:`ensure_graph_loaded`, and

        six refresh sites call it after their own COMMIT -- so there is no
        ordering against ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` to invert. (That is the hazard the

        dashboard's entity-items lookup. Deliberately NOT called
        from ``__init__``: the constructor runs on the gateway's boot path, and a
        rebuild is proportional to corpus size, so migrating there would stall
        the gateway at boot for a large legacy library. All three readers run on
        a worker thread
        (``run_in_embed_pool`` / ``asyncio.to_thread``), so the one-time cost
        lands on the first search instead of on startup.

        Steady state is a single boolean check. The first caller takes the lock

        The rebuild opens ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``, so a concurrent long import can
        hold the lock past ``busy_timeout`` and raise ``OperationalError``.
        Every caller is a reader whose own query already degrades to "no keyword
        hits" on that error, and letting it escape from here instead turns a
        transient lock into an HTTP 500 -- one that the dashboard's entity lookup
        does not even guard. So a lock failure leaves the index at its old
        representation and returns: the read that follows finds legacy terms,
        which costs the CJK recall this PR restores for that one request and
        nothing else, and ``_fts_index_current`` stays False so the next reader
        retries. Only lock/contention errors are absorbed -- a corrupt database

        persisted, or None when the row is gone.

        ``properties`` is a whole-column rewrite, so a read-modify-write split
        across two statements loses a concurrent writer's change: whoever writes
        last replaces the other's blob wholesale. Every same-row writer that
        derives its blob from a read -- the dashboard's pause/resume, the
        watcher's scan stamps, the sync scheduler's outcome counter and the
        ingest finalize's content-hash stamp -- comes through here, so the
        database serializes them against each other: the write lock is taken
        BEFORE the read (``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``, the shape
        :meth:`retire_auto_registered_folder` uses), so no other writer can land
        between this read and this write, and the UPDATE is guarded with the
        blob it read (``WHERE properties = ?``, the shape
        :meth:`_retire_one_in_txn` uses). Under the lock that guard cannot fail,
        which is the point: it states the invariant in SQL, so a future caller
        that drops the transaction gets a no-op rather than a silent overwrite.
        A writer that works from a snapshot it took earlier and rewrites the
        whole blob would resurrect that snapshot over everything committed since
        -- which is why the finalize stamps a delta here instead.

        A failed ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` is NOT swallowed here, unlike in
        :meth:`retire_auto_registered_folder`: that sweep gets another pass, a
        request does not, so a lock timeout has to reach the caller instead of
        being reported as a missing row.

        ``_without_sync_status``, for the reason that helper documents.

        A writer must use the representation the index already holds, because

        segmented terms to a not-yet-migrated index raises
        ``DatabaseError: database disk image is malformed``. A legacy database
        has legitimate writers before any reader can migrate it -- the orphan
        reclaim in ``_migrate`` runs inside the constructor, and the startup
        watcher sweep can update or delete an item before the first search --
        so "segment unconditionally" is not available.

        **Serialized by SQLite's writer lock, not by a Python lock.** Every
        caller reads this from inside a ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction, and the

        a writer holding SQLite's lock would wait on Python's while the

        A True answer is latched, since ``user_version`` only ever increases, so

            are counted as overflow.
            overflow > 0 -> logger.warning once per call.

        Mutation:
            UPDATE only when aliases actually changed (set difference).

            uri to match on, the only handle left is an id -- and an id is local to

            This is also what makes the plain ``INSERT`` in the sources loop defence in

        The rule and its one exception: an id a local row claims must not be handed to an
        import, UNLESS the claiming row is a document this bundle is restoring. Both
        halves are load-bearing and they fail in opposite directions. The exception is
        keyed on the bundle's own row at the SAME ``(table, source, key)``, which is what
        makes it "this document meeting itself" rather than a blanket amnesty -- so it
        covers every table the bundle states, not only the one whose rows get written. A
        folder file or artifact slug this host still holds owns its chunk correctly, and
        no pass re-derives one withheld here: the scan reaps only a row whose path the
        walk missed and skips a ``done`` row whose mtime and hash did not change.

        Without the rule, a stale group belonging to an UNRELATED document captures the
        item: the claim is read before the item loop, so the id does not exist yet, the
        insert creates it, the claim goes live over content it never owned, and the
        bundle's own row is skipped as claimed -- leaving the item held only by that row,
        so deleting that unrelated document destroys imported content.

        Without the exception, restoring a document meets its own row. ``_delete_item_
        cascade`` removes an item and leaves the doc-state group naming it, which is the
        documented normal shape, so re-importing an export would meet the deleter's own
        row and withhold the very item the bundle is the only copy of. That holds whether
        the row owns anything live or not: a per-chunk delete leaves a surviving sibling,
        and the row is then live AND the document being restored at once. The accepting
        pass repoints or merges that row, so withholding there contradicts it instead of
        guarding it.

        Runs INSIDE :meth:`import_bundle`'s transaction and AFTER the item loop,
        because the test a row has to pass is which items the import actually wrote.

        A row owns the items THIS import inserted for it, and nothing else. Ownership
        means "these items, all of them", so an id the bundle ships that ALREADY
        existed here is left out: ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` skipped it, the row in the store
        is local content, and naming it would hand a foreign document the authority to
        replace or delete something this store owns. Unowned local content -- residue
        from an interrupted ingest -- is the case that makes that load-bearing rather
        than theoretical.

        What the import DID write is a different statement, and refusing it is what
        strands content. A second bundle for a document already here brings exactly
        that shape: the first restore put part of the group down, so the second's row
        names ids it did not insert alongside ids it did. Dropping the whole row leaves
        the new chunks searchable and owned by nothing -- ``agent_item_state`` is the
        one table a bundle restores and no pass reaps it, so the document's own delete
        takes the ids its row names and walks past the rest. The arriving ids therefore
        join the live local row's group WHEN that row's own group overlaps the bundle's,
        which is what says the two are one document coming back. This pass tests that
        itself rather than inheriting it from the blocking pass, which cannot supply it:
        an id two bundle rows both name is shared, so it is never blocked, and it arrives
        with a DISJOINT live row sitting on its key. Merging there would file it under an
        unrelated local document whose own delete would then destroy it, so such a row is
        skipped and its items arrive unowned, reported as ``ownership_row_key_held_locally``.
        A merge extends that row's group and touches nothing else, because its hash,
        name and status describe this store's copy and the bundle can be older than it.

        A row with nothing left to own is dropped rather than repaired, and its items
        arrive unowned: an empty group is a de-duplication claim or a scan marker,
        both of which describe the exporting store's progress and are re-derived
        here by the next ingest of that document.

        The status written is the table's own live value rather than the bundle's:
        the surviving group is what makes a row live, and the vocabularies differ
        per table (see :data:`_DOC_STATE_TABLES`).

        A local row for the same document keeps its identity while it OWNS live items,
        and only its group grows. One with an empty or stale group is holding a marker,
        not ownership, so the imported row takes its place and its claim on another
        source's items is released with it.
