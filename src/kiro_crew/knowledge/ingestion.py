    """Rolling-window ceiling on chunks ingested through the EXPLICIT import paths.

    The watcher path (folder sweep) already has its own per-sweep and global
    chunk budgets; those are bounded by a scan (one pass over one source). The
    explicit routes -- single-file add, agent ``knowledge_add_document``, direct
    text ingest, remote sync -- are many independent calls in succession with no
    scan boundary, so there is nothing to total the cost across files. This is
    the equivalent ceiling for that path: a rolling 60-second window over which
    at most ``budget`` chunks may be ingested.

    ``budget=0`` disables it (unbounded). Per-file cost stays bounded by the
    chunker's 50-chunk cap independently; this bounds the CROSS-FILE total.

    The gate is enforced at CALL granularity, not chunk granularity: a file whose
    real cost pushes the window PAST ``budget`` still completes (its chunks are
    already produced), and the NEXT call is the one refused. So the effective
    bound is ``[budget, budget + MAX_CHUNKS_PER_FILE)`` -- a run of adds can end at
    most one file's worst case (50 chunks) above ``budget``, never unbounded. This
    is deliberate: the alternative -- rejecting a file mid-flight once its chunk
    count is known -- would waste the extraction already spent and is the
    silent-truncation failure this exists to avoid. Treat ``budget`` as a soft
    ceiling with a bounded, single-file overshoot, not a hard cap.

    Trip behaviour is REFUSE, not truncate: a single-file cap that silently
    dropped part of a user's deliberate import would be a worse failure than the
    cost it prevents. :meth:`reserve` raises :class:`ImportChunkBudgetError` at
    entry, before any chunking/extraction cost is incurred; an accepted file
    always runs to completion, its reservation settled to its real chunk count.

    Concurrency: the caller does ``reserve()`` (synchronous), then awaits the
    chunk/extract work, then ``settle()``. If N imports each only checked a
    running total they would all pass before any recorded, overrunning by
    concurrency x file. So ``reserve`` books a placeholder of the per-file
    maximum (:data:`~kiro_crew.knowledge.chunker.MAX_CHUNKS_PER_FILE`) INTO the
    window immediately, and that reservation is visible to every concurrent
    ``reserve`` across the await -- ``settle`` later reconciles it down to the
    real count. The reservation is an UPPER bound, so a burst is refused a little
    early rather than allowed to overrun; the worst residual error is one file's
    slack per in-flight import, never unbounded. Every caller is on the event
    loop and reserve/settle/release are synchronous and non-awaiting, so no lock
    is needed (unlike the embed limiter, whose refill straddles an await).

        coroutine returns puts several awaits between the items becoming durable
        and the record that makes them replaceable -- each one a cancellation
        point that strands the items unowned. Passing the write in here gives it
        the same run-to-completion guarantee as the delete it belongs with.

        ``on_duplicate`` is that same bargain for the branch where the pre-ingest
        gate REFUSES the write. It receives the extracted-text hash matched by the
        gate and runs inside the gate's transaction, recording whatever terminal
        state the caller keys by document. Leaving it to the caller is not merely riskier here than on the
        success branch, it is unsound: ``run_to_completion`` guarantees the gate
        finishes and then re-raises the cancellation, so a shutdown lands with the

        ------------------------------------------
        Two lookup passes to find an existing entity before creating a new row:

        Pass 1 — ``find_entity(name)`` (single call, covers canonical + alias):
            ``find_entity`` performs exact → case-insensitive → alias scan.
            * Canonical hit (candidate name casefold == name casefold): reuse
              without a type guard.  Same canonical name means the same
              real-world entity regardless of how the LLM typed it; a type guard
              here would create a duplicate row on every re-ingest because there
              is no ``UNIQUE(name)`` constraint and no merge path.
            * Alias hit (candidate name differs from name): apply a type-conflict
              guard.  A mismatch signals different real-world entities sharing an
              alias; the incoming entity gets a new row.  Covers KO→EN where the
              Korean entity already carries the English name as an alias.

        Pass 2 — Alias fallback via ``find_entity_by_canonical_name(alias)``:
            Called for each extracted alias.  Reuses only when found AND entity
            types do not conflict.  Covers EN→KO: the English entity is stored
            first; later Korean extraction matches the English name as an alias.

        Safety invariants preserved across all passes:
          - Alias-to-alias matches are never sufficient on their own.
          - Only one of: (incoming name == existing canonical) or
            (incoming name ∈ existing aliases) or
            (incoming alias == existing canonical) triggers reuse.
          - Transitive alias chains cannot merge unrelated entities.
          - Entity-type conflicts in alias hits always produce a new entity
            (not a silent merge); both passes normalise missing/empty types to
            ``'concept'`` before comparing.

        Enrichment is scoped to the match type to prevent transitive merges:
          - Canonical match: enrich with incoming ``aliases`` only (``name``
            is always dropped by ``add_entity_aliases`` because it equals the
            canonical and wastes a lock acquisition per entity)
          - Alias hit (Pass 1) or Pass 2: enrich only with ``[name]`` or nothing
            (adding the incoming entity's own aliases enables transitive
            collisions where a later canonical ``DC`` entity incorrectly reuses
            a city entity that carries ``DC`` as an alias)

    — a partial-failure retry skips already-done items, and a re-run on an unchanged
    setup is a no-op. ``force=True`` re-embeds every active item regardless of sig
    (escape hatch for suspected vector corruption).

    Vectors are overwritten one item at a time so search stays queryable throughout.

    ``memory.embedding_bulk_threads`` pool) and idles between rows per
    ``memory.embedding_bulk_duty`` (see :func:`kiro_crew.embeddings.bulk_pace_delay`).
    Paced is the default so a caller that forgets the argument gets the quiet
    behaviour. ``pace=False`` is for a sweep a human explicitly asked for and is
    watching a progress bar on: it embeds at ``PRIORITY_NORMAL`` and never idles.
    ``pace`` selects the scheduling class as well as the idling — an attended
