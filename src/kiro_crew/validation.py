"""Centralized input/output validation for MCP tools and API endpoints.

All tool inputs from untrusted sources (LLM, end user, other MCP tools)
are validated here before execution.  Responses are sanitized and
truncated before returning to callers.

Implements: SDO-183 (Tool Input and Response Validation)
- Schema validation with type enforcement
- Length and size limits
- Unicode normalization and hidden character stripping
- Allow-list approach for enums and key patterns
- Semantic/business logic checks (positive numbers, valid timestamps, etc.)
- Response truncation to prevent resource exhaustion

# ── Tool Schemas (File I/O) ──

#: Syntactic shape gate for a filesystem path arriving over the dashboard's
#: file endpoints. It admits POSIX (``/x``, ``~/x``) *and* native Windows
#: (``C:\x``, ``C:/x``, UNC ``\\host\share\x``) absolute paths. A prefix is
#: still required, so a bare relative path is still refused --
#: the endpoints that support relative input rewrite it to an absolute path
#: via ``_resolve_project_relative`` under ``resolve=1``, ahead of this gate.
#:
#: One pattern rather than a ``sys.platform`` branch: a drive letter and a UNC
#: root have no meaning on POSIX, so accepting those shapes there grants
#: nothing, and a single pattern cannot drift
#: between platforms the way two would. This is a *syntax* gate only -- the
#: security boundary is downstream, where ``hooks.validate_file_path``
#: canonicalizes through ``realpath`` (resolving ``..`` and following symlinks)
#: and refuses the resolved target via ``is_sensitive_path``.
#:
#: The prefix alternation is matched separately from the body so that ``:``
#: stays confined to a drive prefix: an NTFS alternate data stream
#: (``C:\x\file.txt:hidden``, which reads a different byte stream than the path
#: the caller appears to name) has a ``:`` in the body and is still refused.
#: A drive-relative path (``C:x``) is likewise refused -- it resolves against a
#: per-drive working directory the caller cannot see.
#:
#: The body is a DENYLIST, not an allowlist of punctuation. Every filesystem
#: this gate fronts accepts any byte but the separator and NUL in a name, so an
#: enumerated allowlist refuses legal files -- ``Notes (draft).md``,
#: ``Q1 2026 #2.md``, ``50% done.md``, ``report [final].md`` -- and returns
#: HTTP 400 for each. Only two classes are hazards in the path *string* itself
#: and both stay refused: a control character, which truncates at NUL, splits a
#: log line at CR/LF, and injects a terminal escape at ESC or at the 8-bit C1
#: forms a UTF-8 terminal decodes the same way (U+0085 NEL, U+009B CSI); and
#: ``:`` in the body, for the alternate-data-stream reason above. The deny range
#: therefore spans C0, DEL and C1 -- no filesystem name legitimately carries a
#: control character, so the wider range costs nothing. Nothing else is excluded,
#: because nothing downstream interprets the string: every subprocess in the
#: file handlers is ``exec``-form argv with no shell, and the required absolute
#: prefix means the path can never be read as a leading-dash option.

# EVERY computer-use tool MUST have an entry here, including the ones with no
# arguments. Two independent reasons, both load-bearing:
#
#   1. A tool absent from its schema map passes its arguments RAW through the
#      server's ``_validate_args`` (the ``if schema:`` fallback the cron/core
#      servers use), so an unvalidated dict would reach a handler that can
#      synthesize keystrokes into another application's window.
#   2. The dispatcher refuses any tool name not present here, which makes this
#      dict the registration surface: a tenth tool added without a row is
#      rejected rather than silently ungoverned.
#
# Bounds come from ``computer_use.types`` rather than being re-spelled, so the
# schema ceiling and the driver's own budgets cannot drift. ``element_index`` is
# an ``int`` FieldSpec, which ``validate_field`` guards against a bool
# masquerading as an int (``True == 1`` would otherwise pass a range check and
# address element 1).
_CU_SCROLL_DIRECTIONS = frozenset(_cu_types.SCROLL_DIRECTIONS)
