"""Session transfer — copy a session between Kiro Crew instances.

Two halves live here:

* :func:`build_transfer_bundle_async` serialises one slot's visible conversation
  into a portable, version-tagged dict. Called on the **sending** side.
* :func:`api_chat_slot_import` accepts such a dict and materialises it as a new
  slot. Called on the **receiving** side.

The wire hop between them is an ordinary authenticated dashboard request over
an Instances tunnel; see [instances.md](../../../docs/system-specs/modules/instances.md) §14.

``session_export`` is the third consumer: it streams the SAME bundle to a file
so the two machines need not be online at the same time. It adds no format.
``bundle_version`` stays 2 and the ``source`` record below is additive, because
:func:`_validate_bundle` refuses an unrecognised version outright while silently
dropping keys it does not know: a version bump would stop an instance that has
not updated from receiving anything, where a new optional key costs it nothing.
Nothing in this module ever requires a field to be present.

**``source`` is recorded, never applied.** It carries what the conversation ran
under — model, reasoning effort, tool-approval policy, workspace, project, plus
the export instant and the producing gateway's version — for a HUMAN reading the
file to judge what they are looking at. No import path reads it, and
``approval_policy`` in particular is never applied: ``"auto"`` means auto-approve
every tool, so applying a recorded copy would let a session arrive on another
machine pre-authorised to run tools without prompting. An imported session always
lands interactive.

**Two layers travel.** *Layer A* is the visible transcript (the bundle's
``messages``) — what the imported tab DISPLAYS. *Layer B* (bundle_version 2) is
the kiro-cli context window itself (``<sid>.json`` + ``<sid>.jsonl``, stored
outside the crew home and joined via ``session_map.json``): carrying it lets the
imported session RESUME with full fidelity through ``session/load`` rather than
replaying the transcript as a lossy ~8K prefix. Layer B is optional — a v1
sender, or a session that never opened a kiro-cli context, ships Layer A only
and the peer falls back to the prefix. Sub-agent conversations do NOT travel;
their results already live inside Layer B as injected context.

**Copy, never move.** Import always allocates a NEW slot key and never touches
an existing session, so a transfer leaves the source intact and can be repeated
safely. Nothing here deletes anything.

**What deliberately does NOT travel.** A session's transcript is portable text,
but most of its *metadata* is a reference into the local instance's object graph
— a project path, a folder id, a workspace's memory, an agent template, a bound
artifact. Carrying those across would produce dangling references that render
as broken UI on arrival, so the bundle carries the transcript, the title, and an
agent *hint* only:

* ``project`` is intentionally dropped. The source's checkout path almost never
  exists on the target host (a Mac worktree path on a Linux dev desk), and a
  slot pointing at a missing directory scopes file search and steering to
  nothing. The imported session arrives with no project so the user re-picks it.
* ``model`` is not carried. Accounts differ in entitlement, so a model id that
  the source account is served can fail at runtime on the target; the target
  resolves its own default instead (see
  docs/system-specs/common/model-selection.md).
* ``workspace`` is not carried. Workspaces are per-instance memory scopes, and a
  name that matches on both hosts still means two different memories.
* ``agent`` is carried as a hint and applied ONLY if the target has an agent by
  that name; otherwise it is dropped rather than left dangling.
* ``folder_id``, ``tags``, ``pinned``, ``artifact``, ``app``,
  ``linked_session_key`` and ``forked_from`` are all local-graph references and
  are not carried at all. The arriving session's PLACEMENT is nonetheless not the
  top level: it is derived locally from ``origin`` by
  :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.arrival_folders`, which files it under
  ``Imported`` / ``from <sender>``. That is the opposite of carrying the sender's
  ``folder_id`` — no id crosses the wire, and the folder is one on THIS instance.

#: from an older one; anything OUTSIDE the set is refused rather than
#: best-effort parsed, because a silently misread field lands as corrupted
#: conversation.
_SUPPORTED_BUNDLE_VERSIONS = (1, 2)

_MAX_LAYER_B_CHARS = 40_000_000

#: Structural allowance over the two content ceilings: the keys, quotes, commas
#: and ``\uXXXX`` escapes a bundle sitting at both ceilings still needs. Named
#: rather than folded into the total so the derivation below stays readable.
_JSON_ENVELOPE_SLACK = 8 * 1024 * 1024

#: Ceiling on the DECOMPRESSED request body. A compressed upload is an amplifier
#: — a megabyte of gzip expands to roughly a gigabyte of repeated bytes — so the
#: expansion has to be bounded before it is materialised, not after.
#:
#: **What makes this safe is the comparison to the gateway's own body limit, not
#: the arithmetic below.** The Application's ``client_max_size`` is 60 MiB and
#: applies to every body, compressed or not, so the PLAIN path can never deliver
#: more than 60 MiB of JSON. This ceiling is above that, which means the gzip path
#: accepts strictly MORE than the plain path can: a bundle refused here is a
#: bundle the plain path refuses too.
#:
#: The magnitude is taken from the validator's own ceilings —
#: ``_MAX_TOTAL_CHARS`` of transcript plus ``_MAX_LAYER_B_CHARS`` of Layer B
#: events, plus envelope slack — so the number moves with them rather than being
#: chosen freshly. It is deliberately NOT the worst-case ENCODED width: those
#: ceilings count CHARACTERS, and ``json.dumps(ensure_ascii=True)`` renders one
#: non-ASCII character as a six-byte ``\uXXXX`` escape, so a bundle that is valid
#: by character count can be several times larger in bytes. Sizing for that worst
#: case would mean admitting a ~360 MB allocation on an authenticated write route
#: to accommodate a session of ~11M CJK characters — which ``client_max_size``
#: refuses on the plain path anyway. The bound stays where it protects memory, and
#: the bundle that theoretically loses out is one no route has ever accepted.
_MAX_DECOMPRESSED_BYTES = _MAX_TOTAL_CHARS + _MAX_LAYER_B_CHARS + _JSON_ENVELOPE_SLACK

#: The gateway Application's own body limit (``dashboard/server.py``), restated so
#: the invariant above can be tested rather than asserted in prose.
_GATEWAY_CLIENT_MAX_SIZE = 60 * 1024 * 1024

#: How many bodies may be expanding at once, and how many may be waiting to.
#:
#: :data:`_MAX_DECOMPRESSED_BYTES` bounds ONE request; without a concurrency bound
#: N authenticated requests each hold up to that much — first as bytes, then as
#: the parsed document — for as long as their arrival takes, and the sum is what
#: exhausts the host rather than any single body. So a permit covers the whole
#: arrival, not just the expansion: see :func:`_read_bundle_body`. Two in flight
#: bounds resident expansion to roughly twice the ceiling; a small queue absorbs
#: ordinary bursts (a person installing several files) while anything past it is
#: refused immediately rather than parked, because a queue that grows without
#: limit is the same failure with a delay in front of it.

#: gzip's own framing magic (RFC 1952 §2.3.1). The body format is sniffed from

    the transcript tail, so what the file says the session ran under matches the
    turns the file carries.

    The tool-approval policy is read from the LIVE session
    (``SessionManager.get_approval_policy``), which is its only home: it is

    disk read off the event loop.

    Carries the FULL conversation rather than only the window currently held in
    memory — a long-running session keeps just its tail resident, and bundling
    ``slot.messages`` alone would silently truncate the transfer to that tail.
    *origin* is a human label for where the session came from (an instance name
    or ``"local"``); it is recorded for provenance and shown on arrival.

    *with_source* adds the ``source`` provenance record of
    :func:`build_source_record`. It is OFF by default so the tunnel keeps
    producing exactly the bundle it produces today: a peer's importer would drop
    the key harmlessly, but a send is an existing working flow and this feature
    has no business changing what it puts on the wire. The file export turns it
    on, because a file outlives the tab it came from and a reader of one has
    nothing else to tell them what the session ran under.

    *include_layer_b* is the gate on the model's context window; it defaults to
    carrying Layer B. The tunnel send uses that default, so a copy pushed between
    two live gateways RESUMES rather than replaying a lossy prefix. The file
    export does NOT use the default: it passes ``True`` only when the operator has
    opted in both at the config layer (``dashboard.export_include_layer_b``, off by
    default) and on the specific request, because a downloaded file can be shared
    with another person and unredacted context must not ride along unasked (the
    RFC's conjunctive minimum bar, rfc-s3-backup.md:317-319; the risk is the
    operator's per O1). Layer B ships byte-exact and unredacted (see
    :func:`_read_layer_b`), which is forced rather than chosen -- the thinking-block
    signatures inside it are validated on replay, so redacting and transplanting
    cannot both hold, and there is no redacted variant. A caller passing ``False``
    withholds it and the bundle sets ``layer_b_skipped``, so the lost resume
    fidelity is stated rather than inferred from an absent key. Even when a caller
    asks to carry Layer B, this builder still withholds it for a mid-turn snapshot
    (see below), using the same ``layer_b_skipped`` flag; that consistency decision
    is independent of the caller's gate. A session that never opened a kiro-cli
    context sets neither ``layer_b`` nor ``layer_b_skipped``, because there is no
    context to lose.

    The un-flushed tail is a ``_disk_window_len`` boundary slice, which is valid
    only because the flush below runs first: the save folds a durable injector's
    ``append_if_absent`` copy into the window and advances the boundary, so the
    counter is honest by the time the tail is snapshotted. A caller that bundled
    WITHOUT flushing could not use this slice — a durable injector
    (``cron_inject``, ``workflow_inject``) puts the same row into
    the window and onto disk without a save, so the boundary would start one row
    too early and ship the injection twice. There is deliberately no such
    caller: this is the only builder, and it always flushes.

    The transcript read is synchronous file IO plus JSON parsing over a whole
    session, which is exactly the "large synchronous file IO" the
    ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` rule forbids on the loop: on a long
    session it stalls every other task, and because the liveness heartbeat is
    itself a coroutine a stalled loop cannot pet LoopStallWatchdog, which then
    exits the gateway.

    **Offloading introduces an await, so the snapshot must be checked for
    consistency.** While we are off the loop the periodic 5s flush can run: it
    writes the dirty tail to disk AND advances ``_resumed_count`` / clears
    ``_dirty``. If that lands between our read and our merge, a naive merge reads
    pre-flush disk content and then sees a clean slot — silently dropping the
    tail from the copy.

    Because a completed flush advances ``_disk_window_len`` (the persisted
    boundary) as it writes, an unchanged value across the await is positive proof
    that no flush landed: ``history`` then corresponds exactly to
    ``messages[:_disk_window_len]``, so the tail merge is consistent. On a change
    we retry against the new state. Messages arriving during the await are
    harmless — they extend the tail we are about to copy, they do not move the
    boundary.

    If the retries are exhausted (a flush would have to land inside every one of
    them, which the 5s cadence makes effectively impossible), the transfer
    **fails** with :class:`SnapshotUnstable`. It deliberately does not fall back
    to an inline read: that would trade a lossy transcript for a blocking one,
    and on a large active session the blocking read is what starves the heartbeat
    into a watchdog-triggered gateway exit. Failing costs nothing here — a
    transfer is a copy, so the source is untouched and the user can just retry —
    which makes it strictly better than either losing turns or wedging the
    gateway.

    Accepts BOTH shapes the two callers actually send, distinguished by the
    body's own first two bytes:

    * **gzip** — the file ``GET /api/chat/slots/{key}/export`` hands the user,
      byte for byte. Reading these bytes as ``request.json()`` answers
      ``transfer_invalid_json``, so accepting the sniffed gzip is what lets the
      product take back the one file it produces without the user gunzipping it
      by hand first.
    * **plain JSON** — what the tunnel's server-to-server ``send_session_bundle``
      posts. The sending side is an independently-updated install, so accepting
      plain JSON keeps a peer that posts uncompressed working; demanding
      compression would break any peer that posts this shape.

    Sniffing the magic rather than branching on ``Content-Type`` is what makes
    that work: a browser uploading a ``.gz`` off disk sends whatever its platform
    guesses, and the format is not the header's to decide when the bytes say it
    plainly.

    Decompression runs off the loop — up to 60 MiB of gzip is real CPU, and this
    module already offloads its other bulk-CPU pass (``_redact_history_rows``)
    for the same reason. It is also ADMITTED rather than simply started: the
    per-body ceiling bounds one request, and the sum across concurrent requests
    is what reaches a host, so :func:`_expansion_admission` caps how many expand
    at once and this returns ``429 transfer_expansion_busy`` past the queue.

    The permit is entered on *keep*, the CALLER's stack, so it is still held when
    this returns. What the bound has to cover is how much decompressed bundle is
    RESIDENT at once, and a bundle is resident — as bytes, then as the parsed
    document — until the arrival that consumes it finishes. Releasing on return
    would leave the count of resident bundles unbounded, which is the sum this
    exists to bound. It costs throughput: a permit is now held across redaction
    and persistence, so concurrent importers reach the queue sooner. That is the
    intended trade, because the alternative bounds the CPU of expansion and not
    the memory.

    # ONE WITNESS ON EVERY PATH TO SUCCESS, AND NO AWAIT BELOW IT. The guard above
    # only fires when the arrival FOLDER went away, so on its own it leaves the
    # common case unchecked: a ``DELETE /api/sessions/{key}`` landing in the
    # folder-existence await removes this transcript and pops the slot while the
    # folder it pointed at is still perfectly fine, so the branch is skipped and
    # the handler would answer ``200 ok`` for data that has already been
    # destroyed. Nothing downstream corrects that -- the success return does not
    # re-arm ``_dirty`` and the delete's pop is terminal -- so the misleading
    # ``ok`` is the permanent record.
    #
    # The second half of that heading carries as much weight as the first, and is
    # why the arrival-row mark sits above: any await between this check and the
    # response reopens the very window the check closes, because the delete lands
    # inside that await and the check has already passed.
    # ``test_a_delete_landing_in_the_shared_row_mark_refuses`` is what keeps an
    # await from drifting back below it.
    #
    # Unconditional rather than an ``elif``, which would be the cheaper shape and
    # the wrong one: a successful ``save_slot_off_loop`` does NOT imply the
    # delete-won guard reached a decision, because ``best_effort`` converts a
    # raising save to ``True``. Checking every time makes "no path reaches ``ok``
    # without passing the witness" true by structure instead of by case analysis,
    # and ``test_the_witness_still_runs_when_the_repair_save_reported_success``
    # is what keeps that shape from being quietly narrowed back to an ``elif``.
    # The cost is one extra ``stat`` per import, which a request already bounded
    # by the live-slot cap can carry.
    #
    # ``session_was_deleted`` is the module's own witness -- already used twice on
    # the EXPORT path here, and its docstring names this caller class: one that
    # republishes a slot's content and so cannot rely on observing the guard's
    # ``False``, because the periodic flush can reach the guard first and clear
    # ``_dirty``. Off the loop because it stats and reads metadata; the export
    # sites call it bare only because the whole builder already runs in a thread.
