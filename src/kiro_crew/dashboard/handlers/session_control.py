    :func:`internal_memory_scope`:

    * a capture failure returns that refusal verbatim
      (``member_identity_unavailable`` 409 for an unavailable or mismatched
      identity); ordinary transport/auth refusals retain their own status;
    * an owner / Global-V1 caller (``scope is None``) falls through to the

    OUT of the surface the operator left open to everyone, not merely strip its
    bypass. Both reads run off the loop and fail closed on an unreadable config,
