"""Read routes and the push frame for a session's CREW LOG.

Two reads and one push, which is the split RFC section 5 asks for: the backend
folds and cuts pages, the frontend renders and pages and never folds (NFR-2).

- ``GET /api/sessions/{id}/crew-log?from=&to=`` -- the entries in a seq range,
  with up to ``MAX_PAGE_REFS`` of the page's refs resolved and the rest reported
  in ``refs_unresolved`` (FR-4).
- ``GET /api/sessions/{id}/crew-log/projection/{name}`` -- one fold's value and
  the ``seq`` it was folded through (FR-5).
- a ``session_projection`` frame per projection whose value moves, pushed when a
  session's crew log grows.

Both routes are gated on the DASHBOARD OWNER, and that is this layer answering a
question the storage layer declines to: ``resolve`` makes no authorization claim
because it has no caller identity to derive one from, and says the first caller
with a permission model owns it. These routes are that caller. A crew log holds
the session's message BODIES, redacted but whole, so the audience is the one
person the conversation belongs to -- which is also why the push goes to owner
sockets rather than every authorized one, an app token among them. The gate is
``require_owner_dashboard_request`` inside each handler; the module also stands
behind ``guard_owner_surface_routes``, which refuses a private member's scoped
caller, so a route added here later is refused rather than open by omission.

The page read and the fold read differ in one deliberate way. A FOLD passes its
vocabulary to ``iter_from``, so an entry from a newer writer stops it instead of
skewing a total nobody can see is wrong. A PAGE passes none: it renders history
for a person, where an unfamiliar line is a missing detail rather than a
corrupted answer, and refusing the whole page for one line would hide the
history in front of it. That is the posture ``crew-log-core`` states for ``page``
and ``resolve``, applied to a range read.
The storage package is imported LAZILY here, on the first call that needs it,
never at module import. The crew log is an optional subsystem behind
``KIROCREW_CREW_LOG``, this module is reachable from the dashboard's boot
path, and a gateway launched with the flag unset must not pay to load a store it
will not read -- the same split the emitter keeps, and one a test pins from a
clean interpreter.

    A session's crew log is keyed by the ACP SESSION ID the turn path holds, and a
    dashboard caller holds neither: a chat surface knows its SLOT key, and the ACP
    id is not on any payload it reads (deliberately -- it is an internal identity,
    and putting it on the wire to let a client rewrite it into a path would widen
    what a client is trusted with). So a slot key is resolved here, through the one
    module that answers this question, rather than by the caller guessing.

    The resolver's answer is preferred when it has one, and the id is used verbatim
    otherwise: an ACP id is not a session KEY, so the registry lookup misses and
    answers ``UNKNOWN`` for one, which is what keeps a unit-id-addressed read
    working unchanged. Two callers on main are of that kind -- the
    ``kirocrew-crew-log`` MCP server reads a unit by id through the unit-keyed door,
    and the ``session_projection`` frame carries the unit it folded as
    ``session_id``, so anything taking an id out of a frame addresses by unit id.
    It is a registry read with no disk in it, so it stays on the loop while the
    read itself goes to a thread.

    An unresolvable key -- a slot that never ran a turn, one whose ACP session was
    torn down -- keeps the given id and reads back an empty fold. What this function
    ALSO reports is whether the resolver answered, because that is the difference
    between "this unit holds no entries" and "no unit is addressable for this id
    right now", and only the caller of the second kind can be told the truth. A
    slot whose session was reset keeps its record on disk under the retired ACP id;
    telling its reader "nothing recorded for this session" would be false.

    This does NOT fall back to the persisted session map to find that retired id,
    for two reasons that are each decisive. ``SessionMap.get`` repairs or removes an
    entry it judges stale, so consulting it would make a panel read mutate session
    state -- the exact reason ``crew_log/resolve.py`` documents for not touching it.
    And a retired unit belongs to a different session from the one this slot serves:
    presenting its totals here would imply a whole-life figure that needs the lineage
    pointer (``session/opened.data.previous``) and a fold that follows it, and this
    module has neither. So the honest move is to say what is addressable, not to
    guess.

# The agent's door: unit-keyed reads the kirocrew-crew-log MCP server proxies
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# A SECOND prefix rather than a second gate on the two routes above, and the
# distinction is the authorization model, not the bytes. Those routes are keyed by
# the session id the SPA already holds and are gated on the owner's cookie; these
# are keyed by a crew log UNIT, are reachable over the internal-secret transport,
# and require the strict session identity the proxy forwards. One handler serving
# both would be one gate that has to be right for two callers whose identity
# arrives from different places, which is how a read widens by accident.
# The page and the fold themselves are the SAME implementations -- ``_read_page``
# and ``projection.read_projection`` -- so the two doors cannot answer differently.
#
# What the internal arm asks for is a strict session identity AND a scope: a
# session may read its own unit, the unit of any session it dispatched -- however
# many generations down -- and, if it is the owner at a dashboard tab, any unit at
# all. That third case is the one this module has always had; the second is what
# the decision added, and it exists because a conductor reading the crew logs of
# the sub-sessions it dispatched is the ordinary shape of the work rather than a
# special case.
#
# It is a DISPATCH fence, not an operator fence. The premise "sessions on a Kiro
# Crew gateway belong to one operator, so any of them may read any other" was
# considered and is not the rule here, for a reason that is about surfaces rather
# than about trust: a channel-linked session's conversation is a Slack or Telegram
# thread, so several allow-listed people read it and prompt-injectable content
# enters it. "One operator" does not reach that, and it is exactly the caller class
# an unscoped read would admit.
#
# Do NOT read the wider rule as parity with ``session_read_message`` either. That
# tool does return a peer session's transcript, but
# ``session_control.authorize_target`` is a substantially narrower gate: it refuses
# an unattended caller (``cron:``, ``taskrunner:``), an app-scoped caller or
# target, an incognito or temporary caller or target, and a channel-linked or
# channel-mirrored caller or target -- that last one explicitly because a linked
# caller's reads land in a channel thread in front of people who were never party
# to them. It also addresses only currently-open sessions and sits behind
# ``agent.session_control``. Those caller-class exclusions are MIRRORED below, and
# their constants are imported from that module rather than restated so the two
# gates cannot drift.
#
# The target side of that gate is mirrored too, and in TWO tests rather than one,
# because the question is asked about sessions that have CLOSED. The first reads
# the target's own ``session/opened`` entry, which records what kind of session the
# log belongs to; that is what makes a CLOSED child decidable, and a log that does
# not carry the record is refused rather than assumed unrestricted, so every unit
# opened before the record existed is outside a cross-session read. The second reads
# the target's live slot, which is the only thing that can see a class the session
# ACQUIRED after it opened -- a channel link added mid-conversation. Either refuses;
# neither admits on the other's behalf. Exact parity with ``authorize_target`` is
# still not the goal: that gate answers 404 for a closed session, and reading a
# finished child's recorded log is the whole point here.
#
# The fence is keyed on SLOTS, not on unit ids. A slot outlives its ACP session, so
# a gateway restart gives the same tab a new session id and therefore a new unit: a
# fence keyed on the recorded ``parent.sid`` would hand a conductor a chain naming
# one of its own earlier units and lock it out of the children it dispatched minutes
# earlier. The slot key carries its own creation stamp and is not recycled. The
# transitive walk is ``crew_log.session_tree``'s own fold rather than a second slot map
# here, so the tree this fence trusts is the tree the Sessions page draws.
#
# What it therefore refuses: a caller off the internal transport (a browser has its
# own door), a request naming another component, a caller whose session the gateway
# cannot name or cannot place as a slot, a caller in one of the mirrored classes
# reading anything but its own unit -- INCLUDING an owner's dashboard tab that is
# mirrored to a channel, because that tab republishes every turn -- a unit outside
# the caller's own dispatch tree, a target whose log does not record its class, and
# a target in one of the mirrored classes by either its record or its live slot. The
# identity requirement is the load-bearing one -- an
# operator's record of WHICH session read a log is only worth having if the
# identity was resolved strictly rather than walked out of a process tree.

#: The component name this module's internal door recognizes on
#: ``X-Internal-Caller``. Spelled here rather than imported from
#: :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_crew_log`, because that module is an MCP stdio server and

    A key with NO colon is a bare slot name, not a key missing its slot: the crew

    answers ``""``, which every caller treats as a refusal.

    That last answer is the truthful value rather than a guard, and it is deliberately

    The three ways in, tried in this order because it is cheapest first:

    #. the caller's OWN unit -- one resolver call, no slot lookup, and a session
       reading its own recorded history learns nothing it did not produce;
    #. the owner at a dashboard tab, whose caller class must ALSO allow it;
    #. a unit inside the caller's own dispatch tree, once the caller's class, the
       target's recorded class and the target's live class all allow it.

    The caller-class test gates the owner arm as well as the lineage arm, and that
    is deliberate rather than symmetry for its own sake. The exclusions are about
    where a read LANDS: an owner's own tab publishes to the person at it, but a
    dashboard session MIRRORED to a channel republishes every turn, so the same tab
    that may read every unit becomes a republisher of them. A mirrored owner tab is
    therefore held to its own unit like any other excluded caller -- one check at
    the one choke point, rather than an arm that is exempt from the rule the arm
    beside it enforces.

    The fence is keyed on SLOTS. A slot outlives its ACP session: a gateway restart
    gives the same tab a new session id and a new unit, so keying on the recorded
    ``parent.sid`` would hand a conductor a chain naming one of its own earlier
    units and lock it out of children it had dispatched minutes earlier. The recorded
    ``parent.slot`` carries the creating tab's own stamp and is not recycled, so it
    survives the restart; the sid stays on the entry as the audit citation for which
    log held the call.

    Async because the third arm touches the filesystem: it folds the store once, and
    reads the target's opening entry. Both happen in ONE offload, so a cross-unit
    request suspends once rather than per step, and the first two arms answer from
    memory and reach no ``await`` at all.

    The caller-class test is re-asserted AFTER the offload. It reads live session
    state, the ``await`` is a suspension point, and a caller can acquire a channel
    link or lose its persistent memory while the fold runs -- so the verdict this
    returns is decided from state read after the last suspension rather than before
    it.

    A refusal is returned only when the caller has no unit of its own to scope to --
    the same condition the per-unit arm refuses on, and for the same reason: a

    The scope this returns is not the whole answer: the rows admitted by LINEAGE are

    WORKSPACE those belong to. That test is deliberately NOT a blanket one -- it is
    asked only of rows this scope already admitted, so it costs one fold per unit in

    LOOPBACK request carrying no ``X-Internal-Secret``, ``token_auth_middleware``
    falls through to ordinary cookie auth and calls this handler on success
    (``token_auth.py``, "No secret header (browser request)"). Strict membership
    decides only the NON-loopback case -- hard deny, where a mixed path would get
    the cookie fall-through -- and with ``local_only=False`` a strict path is
    reclassified mixed anyway. So a same-machine tab, and a forwarded one once
    remote access is on, both arrive here with a valid cookie and no secret; this
    branch is the only thing that refuses them.

    Refused rather than admitted because the browser already has its own door: the
    cookie-only ``/api/sessions/{id}/crew-log`` pair, which this prefix
    deliberately does not cover. The two doors keep separate authorization models,
    and a cookie admitted here would be a second, unaudited path into this one.

    The rule this arm applies: a valid strict session identity, and then a SCOPE --

    Every read is audited under the operation name the caller passes, which is the

    Called after the offload that BUILDS a payload and before that payload is
    returned. :func:`_authorize_crew_log_read` decides on state read BEFORE the read,
    and the read is a suspension point, so the target's class can move while the
    entries are being read off the loop. Without this, a cross-unit read would deliver
    entries the target appended during the read under a verdict taken before they
    existed -- a one-shot delivery of content the refreshed class governs.

    The target's class IS folded a second time, because this fold reads the log's whole
    life: a ``session/class`` move appended while the payload was being built makes the
    fold answer more restrictively than it did at the grant. The re-fold closes that
    exactly rather than narrowing it, and the exactness comes from where the class is
    RECORDED, not from when it is sampled. Every surface that commits a change to a
    session's class records the change as it commits, so a class governing any content
    in the log is stated in that log ahead of the content, and a fold taken after the
    payload read has therefore seen every class state that could govern what the
    payload carries. The fold is incremental, so on a log that did not move it consumes
    nothing. It only ever moves AWAY from permissive, so this can withdraw a grant and
    never widen one.

    What this DOES buy, stated exactly, because a wider claim would be false: the
    route never hands another session's content to a caller that is publishing AT THE
    MOMENT OF THE HANDOFF. That is an act this route performs and therefore controls.
    The scenario it stops is the one a reviewer named: a prompt to paste a dispatched
    child's log, a mirror bound while the payload read is suspended, and a reply that
    publishes the private log to the channel.

    What it does NOT buy, and this is a KNOWN residual rather than an oversight: a
    caller that was entitled at the handoff and acquires a channel link afterwards
    holds the payload in context and can publish it on a later turn. Nothing at turn
    emission inspects a turn for another session's log content -- there is no
    provenance tracking on read content anywhere in the gateway -- so no refusal here
    can claw that back. The two cases are different in kind, not merely in timing: the
    first is the gateway delivering content INTO a published session, the second is a
    session becoming published while holding content it was entitled to receive. This
    function is the last point of control over the first and has none over the second.
    Closing the second needs provenance on delivered content, which does not exist and
    is not in this change's scope.

    The mark under :data:`TARGET_CLASS_KEY` says whether a TARGET test is owed. An
    owner-granted read must not be target-tested, because an owner reads a published
    unit by entitlement, so without the mark this would refuse what the gate
    deliberately allowed. The caller test runs on every arm regardless, including the
    owner's: an owner tab that acquired a mirror during the read is publishing now.

    On the one arm that suspends AGAIN -- the lineage arm, which refolds the target off
    the loop -- the caller test is read a SECOND time, after that suspension. Answering
    on the pre-suspension reading would leave this route's own window open while it
    closed the payload-build one, which is the same stale-read class it exists to close.
    Both readings refusing is enough, so a re-read can only add a refusal.

    The dispatch edge is NOT folded again: it is recorded the same way and the store is
    append-only, so a second fold can only gain descendants -- it cannot take back a
    unit the caller was already placed above.

    A read of the caller's OWN unit is exempt, matching the first arm of
    :func:`_read_scope_refusal`: the classes govern reading PAST one's own record.

    A LISTING is re-checked too, by recomputing its scope and comparing. Its rows were
    selected under the scope the caller held at the gate, so a caller whose class
    narrowed during the read has rows in hand that its current scope would not have
    gathered. The comparison is what refuses, rather than a test of the rows, which a
    listing deliberately does not class-test.

    The denial is audited under the same operation name the grant was, so the pair
    reads in order in the audit log -- granted, then denied -- which is the true
    account of what happened rather than a grant quietly withdrawn.
