"""Artifacts HTTP handlers — REST endpoints over :class:`ArtifactStore`.

Endpoints
---------
- ``GET    /api/artifacts``                    list (filter by ?tag, ?kind, ?q)
- ``POST   /api/artifacts``                    create (JSON body)
- ``GET    /api/artifacts/{slug}``             read current version
- ``PATCH  /api/artifacts/{slug}``             update (content/name/description/tags)
- ``DELETE /api/artifacts/{slug}``             delete
- ``GET    /api/artifacts/{slug}/versions``    list version numbers
- ``GET    /api/artifacts/{slug}/versions/{n}``  read a specific version
- ``GET    /api/artifacts/{slug}/events``      lifecycle event log

Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Standard dashboard auth (token middleware). Restricted sessions cannot mutate
artifacts; reads are allowed so the agent can iterate from a hook callback.

The HTTP layer is the single source of truth for SEL audit events on artifact
mutations — MCP tools and the CLI both go through here.
