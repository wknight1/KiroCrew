    Returns ``(at_ts, None)`` on success — with ``at_ts`` ``None`` when the body
    names no one-shot at all, which is the recurring case and not an error — or
    ``(None, response)`` carrying a 400 the caller returns verbatim.

    Mirrors ``cron_add``'s **parser and precedence**: ``at`` (absolute epoch
    seconds) wins, then ``delay`` (seconds from now), then ``at_time`` (human
    string, parsed in the CONFIGURED timezone by the shared
    :func:`parse_time_string`), so a one-shot body means the same instant
    whichever door received it. The acceptance sets are NOT identical: the
    resolved-instant ceiling below is stricter than the tool, which bounds only
    its raw fields.

    Four things this refuses that the declared type alone would let through:

    * a bool for ``at``/``delay`` — ``isinstance(True, int)`` is true in Python,
      so a bare ``isinstance`` check would silently read ``True`` as ``1``;
    * a value ``float()`` cannot even represent. JSON integers are unbounded, and
      ``float(10**400)`` raises ``OverflowError`` — uncaught, that is a bare 500
      on a request that never reaches the store;
    * a non-finite float — ``json.loads`` accepts ``NaN`` and ``Infinity`` by
      default, and ``NaN`` defeats every comparison below (each is false), which
      would persist a job whose next run can never arrive;
    * a value outside the schema's own bounds. An unbounded far-future ``at`` is
      not merely a silly job: ``format_schedule`` renders it through
      ``datetime.fromtimestamp``, which raises above year 9999, and it does so
      inside the comprehension that serializes EVERY job — so one poisoned
      record turns the whole cron listing into a 500 until it is deleted by id.
      ``{"at": 1.75e12}`` (epoch MILLIseconds — the ordinary ``Date.now()``
      mistake) is exactly that shape, which is why the bound is enforced here
      rather than left to the store;
    * a time already gone, which would otherwise fire the moment the scheduler
      next ticks rather than when the caller asked.

    The single verified promotion path, reached only through the PUT
    ``approve_pending`` branch (approval lives exclusively on the dashboard
    Schedule page): re-validates the mapping, re-verifies
    the pending pin against the job's CURRENT code (409 ``code_changed`` on
    drift — an approval never blesses code that changed after the request),
    re-checks vault-name existence, then swaps pending -> active in one store
    update.

    ``expected_env``/``expected_ts`` bind the approval to the request the
    approver actually SAW: the agent can replace a pending request at any
    moment (cron_secret_request overwrites), so an approval that does not
    restate the displayed mapping could promote a different request than the
    one reviewed. Both are required and compared unconditionally — an
    optional check is a check the agent can arrange to skip — and a mismatch
    refuses with 409 ``stale_request`` instead of promoting.

    ``expected_source_sha256`` binds the approval to the script BODY the
    approver saw (the ``sha256`` GET ``/api/crons/{id}/script`` returned with
    the source it rendered). The request-level binding above is not enough on
    its own: an agent can rewrite the script and re-issue the request, and a
    dashboard whose request banner refreshed while its source view did not
    would then restate the NEW request's mapping and timestamp — passing both
    checks — while the operator is still looking at the OLD code. The pin only
    proves the code matches the request, never that the approver read it, so
    the approval must present the digest of what it displayed, and a digest
    that does not match the body this promotion pins is a 409 ``stale_source``.
    The field is required, not optional: an approval that omits it is an
    approval of code nobody attested to having seen. And a digest can only
    attest to what was SHOWN, so a body the dashboard cannot render verbatim
    (see ``_display_source``) is refused outright with 409
    ``source_not_reviewable`` — otherwise an agent could hide executable
    content behind a span the redactor masks and the operator would approve a
    raw digest over code the display never let them read.

    duplicates -- and a delete sent without the selector removes both. This
    answers, per row, the selector the delete route defines:

    * ``""`` for an unscoped (global) row -- the route's explicit-global
      selector, so a delete of the global row leaves a same-rule scoped row.
    * the canonical fragment for a scoped row -- the delete compares
      canonically on both sides, so the folded form round-trips onto the row
      and only that row.
    * ``None`` for a row whose stored scope is PRESENT but unusable (an
      imported ``/``, a blank string, a non-string). Both stores classify such
      a row as scoped-but-broken and a scope-selective delete never claims it,
      while the route refuses the raw value as a selector -- so echoing it
      would make the row undeletable from the UI. ``None`` tells the client to
      send no selector, which is the unselective path both stores keep open so
      junk rows stay deletable.

    The classification is the stores' own: ``None`` is global (``learn.py``
    ``remove`` guards on ``is not None``; the vector store's
    ``_lesson_scope_unusable`` answers False for a null), and anything else is
    judged by :func:`scope_is_admissible`, the same predicate both stores use.

    The selector must round-trip byte-exact to name its row, so it cannot be
    rewritten -- but it is still a stored string leaving through this handler,
    and every such string goes through the shared redaction chain. A fragment
    the chain would alter carries a credential shape, and echoing it raw to
    make the row selectable is the one trade this surface must not make: it is
    withheld (``None``) instead, so the row reads as unusable and stays
    reachable only through the unselective delete, exactly like a broken
    scope. A fragment the chain leaves alone is emitted as-is.
