"""HTTP routes for a crew's webview.

Two halves with deliberately different auth, because they are different acts:

* **Publishing** (``/api/agent-panel/*``) is MCP-only and strict-internal. The
  crew a call writes to is derived from the CALLING SESSION's identity
  (``X-Session-Key``, vetted by ``_recognize_session``) and then from that
  session's agent -- never from the request body. So a crew can only ever
  publish its own webview, and raw HTTP with no recognized session identity is
  refused. Restricted (incognito/temporary/guest) sessions are refused too: a
  published panel is durable on-disk state, which is exactly what those modes
  promise not to leave behind.

  Both publish routes are listed in ``server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`` --
  without that entry the internal-secret call falls through to cookie auth and
  every publish fails with 403.

* **Reading** (``/api/members/{slug}/panel``) is an ordinary cookie-authed
  dashboard route, because the drawer is what reads it. It is a read: nothing
  under it can publish or edit a panel.

    Returns ``((slug, crew_name), None)`` or ``(None, refusal)``.

    The crew comes from the session's own agent binding, never from the body: a
    body-supplied name would let one crew publish a webview that presents as
    another's, and the whole point of a per-crew panel is that the operator can
    trust whose state they are reading.

    AUTHORIZATION FIRST, and it cannot be left to the route listing. The crew is
    resolved from a caller-CHOSEN ``X-Session-Key``, so the header is an identity
    claim rather than a lookup key: a caller holding only a dashboard cookie could
    name any live session and have this resolve to THAT crew, then overwrite its
    panel. Requiring ``request["internal_auth"]`` -- set by
    ``token_auth_middleware`` exclusively on a constant-time ``X-Internal-Secret``
    match -- closes the cookie and app-token-over-HTTP variants, and
    ``_deny_app_caller`` closes the one that gate does NOT: an internal caller
    whose identity resolves to an APP.

    Those two are not alternatives, and an earlier version of this docstring
    claimed they were ("never present on a cookie- or app-token-authenticated
    request"). ``token_auth`` sets ``internal_auth`` and then derives
    ``request["app"]`` IN THE SAME BRANCH, precisely so ownership guards
    downstream can see it -- so an app-owned agent granted the panel tools, whose
    slot's ``agent`` happens to name a crew, satisfied the secret gate and
    published as that crew. The read route already denied app callers; the write
    route asserted in prose that it did not need to.

    CSP and the theme variables. Serving it as HTML here would invite loading it

    The raw ``data`` object travels alongside the document, and the drawer's

    lets the panel show the few fields that matter, in the order the crew

    Duplicating the data (it is also inside the document's island) is deliberate
    and bounded: ``publish`` caps it, and the alternative -- parsing it back out
    of the composed HTML -- would make the drawer a consumer of the template's
