    the same identity the peer row carries before anything is bound to it.

    That equality is the whole point. The sidebar keys rows on this value (React
    key, ``layoutId``, ``data-session-row``, the hover-hold seats), so a binding
    that preserves it re-renders ONE row where a fresh key would mount a second
    element beside the row the user clicked and leave the browser to notice they
    are the same conversation.

    The invariant that buys, and the trap in it: for a remote-bound session this
    identity is NOT the local slot key, and never becomes it. Read ``key`` when you
    need the local slot -- switching sessions, loading a transcript, addressing the
    slot on the wire. Splitting this string to recover that key yields the PEER's
