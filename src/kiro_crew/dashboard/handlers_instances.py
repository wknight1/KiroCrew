"""Instances API handlers — owner-only control plane for multi-instance mgmt.

Backs the ``/api/instances/*`` routes. Every route:

* is **gated behind ``instances.enabled``** (default off) — returns 403 when
  the feature is disabled, so toggling requires an explicit opt-in;
* is **owner-only and never reachable via the Slack path** — a request whose
  ``X-Session-Key`` indicates a Slack origin is rejected, so chat-sharing a hub
  can never pivot into SSH control;
* emits a **SEL audit event** on both reads and writes (security observability
  for an SSH-pivoting control plane).

Connect responds with the minted dashboard **token** so the browser can set the
embedded iframe's first-party cookie; that response is the *only* place a token
crosses this boundary, it is never logged, and it never appears in list/status.

    Backs the merged-sessions sidebar preview, where a connected peer's open
    sessions appear as ordinary rows in this machine's Sessions list. Read-only:
    a peer-owned session offers no rename, close or pin, because those are
    local-slot operations that cannot reach a session on another machine.

    Deliberately NOT the frontend calling
    ``/api/instances/{id}/proxy/api/chat/slots``, which is what it did first. The
    peer's reply needs a HUB-SIDE filter that only this process can apply. A local
    session bound to this peer for EXECUTION (``executor == "remote"``) is backed
    by a real slot ON the peer, so the peer lists it like any other of its own —
    and the browser would then render one conversation TWICE: once as the local
    row the user can actually chat in, and once as a read-only peer row that
    navigates away to the instance pane.

    The two are correlated only by the binding's ``remote_slot``, which is
    deliberately not projected to the browser (see ``slot_projection``: it is the
    PEER's slot key, meaningful only inside a request routed back through that
    instance). Filtering here is what keeps it that way — the dedupe runs where
    the binding already lives, so no peer slot key has to cross to the browser to
    make it possible.

    Surviving rows are then re-shaped by ``_clean_peer_slot`` rather than
    forwarded as the peer sent them. A slot title is MODEL-AUTHORED text from
    another machine, and ``slot_projection.py`` redacts a LOCAL slot's title
    (``redact(slot.display_title)``) before the browser ever sees it — so an
    unshaped peer row would have been the one row in that merged list whose text
    never met a redactor. Runtime TYPE validation still lives in the sidebar
    hook, which is the only place that knows what it renders; what happens here
    is field selection and redaction, neither of which the browser can do for
    itself once the bytes have already arrived.

    The reply is bounded twice, in BYTES before decoding and in ROWS before
    shaping, because the two bound different costs — see each bound's own note
    below. An interrupted read is refused with its own code rather than decoded
    from whatever arrived: a short session list is indistinguishable from a
    complete one here, so accepting one would silently lose sessions.

    This route is GET-only, which is narrower than the ``("api", "chat")`` proxy
    row it replaces for this read — that row admits the peer's mutating verbs
    too, and nothing here needs them.
