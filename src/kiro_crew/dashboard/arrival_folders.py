"""Arrival provenance filing — file an arriving session under ``Imported``.

A session can arrive on this instance two ways: a peer pushes one over an
Instances tunnel, and a person installs one exported to a file. Both reach the
single server route :func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.session_transfer.api_chat_slot_import`,
and both are filed here into ``Imported`` / ``from <sender>`` so "where did this
session come from" has an answer that outlives the arriving tab's title.

The decision record is
[rfc-arrival-provenance-filing.md](../../../docs/request-for-change/rfc-arrival-provenance-filing.md);
the tunnel half is a CHANGED DEFAULT for a route that has one, which is why that
document exists. The properties below are the ones that document commits to, each
written where it is enforced:

* **The destination does not depend on the body's format.** One function serves
  both arrival routes. A gzipped file from a person and a plain-JSON bundle from
  the tunnel are the same event carried by different transport, so the encoding
  must not decide placement.
* **``origin`` names a folder and confers nothing.** It is a field of an
  untrusted bundle, so it is read as a LABEL only — never as an identity, never
  compared against a credential. The authorization identity is the caller's,
  resolved by the shared ``effective_request_app`` rule and passed in.
* **An app-scoped arrival touches the folder store not at all.** It neither
  creates nor adopts: the store has a global ceiling
  (:data:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.chat_folders.MAX_CHAT_FOLDERS`), so an app token
  looping imports with distinct ``origin`` values could otherwise fill the cap
  until the person is refused a folder of their own — and adopting the person's
  folder instead would file peer content into a row they own.
* **Find-or-create is atomic.** Both levels are settled inside ONE
  ``mutate_folders`` transaction, the shape
  :func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.channel_folders.ensure_channel_folder` already
  uses. Two arrivals from one peer racing each other cannot each observe the
  folder absent and each create one.
* **A folder is looked up in the form the store WRITES it.**
  ``create_folder_record`` trims and clips a name before appending it, so
  :func:`store_folder_name` applies the same transformation before the lookup —
  otherwise a long sender name is compared untruncated, misses the clipped row a
  previous arrival wrote, and creates a duplicate on every arrival.
* **Filing is best-effort.** A refusal — the ceiling, a store write failure —
  returns ``""`` and the session lands unfiled. The transcript is the payload and
  the grouping is convenience, so this must never fail an import that works
  today.

Folder names are ASCII English literals. A folder created here is an ordinary
sidebar row the person can rename, reparent or delete, and a name re-derived per
render from the active locale would fight that rename and would move the folder
every time the interface language changed.

#: went away"

#: An optional key, the shape ``create_folder_record`` already uses for ``color``,

#:
#: One-way. Once a row has been shared it is never reclaimed by a rollback again,
#: which errs toward leaving an empty row the person can delete rather than

      Deleting it then would unfile somebody else's session, so a row any slot
      points at is LEFT ALONE.
    * **Still empty of folders.** A row whose child survived — because the child
      was adopted rather than created — keeps that child from being orphaned.

    Walked in REVERSE so the child is considered before its parent; once the

    **Cancellation is not covered.** The handler's ``CancelledError`` arm rolls
    back synchronously on purpose — awaiting inside a cancelled task is not
    dependable — and this is async because the store lock is. A shutdown or
    disconnect mid-import can still leave a row behind.
