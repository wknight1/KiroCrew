"""Surface channel-originated sessions in the dashboard's active chat list.

A conversation started on Slack (or Discord/Telegram/Teams/…) persists under a
channel-namespaced session key such as ``slack:<thread_ts>``. The dashboard's
slot restore paths only ever built slots for ``dashboard:``-prefixed keys, so
those conversations existed on disk but had no chat slot — they only appeared
in the sidebar's collapsed **History** pane, where the user had to search for
one and resume it by hand.

This module reconciles recent channel sessions INTO slots so they show up in
the active chat list, ready to continue.

Design notes:

* **One session, one transcript, two surfaces.** The slot's key is derived from
  the channel session key (``slack:1785370133.085469`` ->
  ``slack_1785370133.085469``) so the sidebar reads provenance straight off it,
  but the slot is BOUND to the channel session via ``linked_session_key``. That
  binding is what makes the tab the conversation rather than a picture of it:
  turns run on the channel's own session (one ``kiro-cli`` process, one
  ``Semaphore``), and because ``history._safe_key`` folds ``slack:<ts>`` and the
  ``slack_<ts>`` filename stem onto the same file, the slot's transcript IS the
  channel transcript. A reply typed in the tab reaches the thread; a message
  sent in the thread appears in the tab.

  The binding is persisted to the transcript's metadata line, because nothing
  else recreates it: a cron slot is re-bound by its next injection, but a
  channel slot has no such trigger, so without persistence a gateway restart
  would silently downgrade the tab to a disconnected copy.
* **Recency-bounded.** Only sessions modified within the dashboard's configured
  ``restore_window_minutes`` become slots, so a long DM history does not turn
  into hundreds of tabs. Pinned and foldered sessions are exempt from the
  window, matching :func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.chat_persistence.restore_recent_sessions`.
* **Closed is sticky — until the channel moves on.** A session the user closed
  on the dashboard (``meta.closed``) is not re-surfaced by the next reconcile
  pass — otherwise closing the tab would be undone 30 seconds later. But a
  close is a statement about the conversation *as it stood*: channel-side
  activity strictly newer than the close (the person kept talking on Discord
  after the tab was dismissed) re-surfaces it, and the stale ``closed`` flag is
  cleared so every restore path agrees the tab is open again. When the close
  instant is unknown (legacy flag with no ``closed_at`` stamp and no readable
  file mtime), the close stands — fail toward the user's explicit dismissal.

  Closing a tab drops the surface, not the conversation: the channel session
  keeps running and the next message from either side resumes it with full
  history.
* **Ephemeral stays ephemeral.** ``incognito``/``temporary`` channel threads are
  skipped: the user asked for a conversation that leaves no trace, and a
  durable sidebar tab contradicts that.
* **Idempotent.** Every pass is a no-op for sessions that already own a slot,
  so it is safe to run on a timer.

    leave the placement alone. That refusal is why switching the setting on does

    The explicit counterpart to the automatic filing in

    are first surfaced, which leaves every conversation that existed BEFORE the
    setting was switched on untouched, with no affordance anywhere to catch them
    up. This is that affordance.

    Reached only from a button the user clicks, never from a timer and never as a
    side effect of saving settings, so nothing here moves a conversation without
    an instruction that named the folder. Two independent reasons for that shape
    rather than one: a settings save fires on every unrelated field too (a
    token-only save would silently bulk-move conversations), and the moves are
    not collectively undoable, so the user has to be the one asking.

    Returns a report, not a count. Because there is no undo, the response names
    every conversation it moved -- that list is what lets the user put one back
    by hand, and it is the only record of what happened.

    ``reason`` distinguishes the ways this can do nothing, which a count of zero
    cannot: ``not_configured`` (the setting is off for this channel),
    ``folder_missing`` (configured, but no folder answered to that name when the
    pass started -- never created, or a hand-edited config), ``folder_gone`` (the
    folder was there and was DELETED while the pass ran), ``unavailable`` (the
    conversation store is absent or its listing raised, so nothing was even
    attempted), ``all_failed`` (every attempted write failed), and ``""`` for a
    pass that actually ran.

    ``folder_missing`` and ``folder_gone`` are deliberately NOT one value, for the
    same reason ``unavailable`` and ``all_failed`` are not: the remedies are
    opposite. Saving the settings creates a folder that was never there, and does
    nothing for conversations already stamped with the id of one that has been
    deleted -- recreating mints a fresh id, so those are stranded and have to be
    moved by hand. A single value made the panel infer which case it had from
    ``failed``/``moved``, which is a claim about this function's control flow made
    in the client.

    ``unavailable`` and ``all_failed`` are deliberately NOT one value. They need
    opposite sentences: one says a read failed, the other says the reads worked
    and the writes did not, and only the second has a count worth reporting.
