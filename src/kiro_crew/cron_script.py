"""Code-based cron scripts — deterministic Python as cron callbacks.

Scripts under ``<config_dir>/crons/`` are LLM-writeable by design. The sandbox +
path-restriction prevents filesystem escape, but the LLM can register

is_sensitive_path() blocks credential files, auto-pause after 5 consecutive

    under the vault-derived grant key with the grant epoch bound in — see
    :func:`_pin_digest` for the trust model of each domain.

    The pin binds, in one digest: the DOMAIN (``pending`` for an
    agent-requested grant awaiting approval, ``active`` for an operator-minted
    grant the runners honour — so a pending pin copied verbatim into the
    active fields never verifies), the JOB ID (a pin cannot be replayed onto

    run's output lands under a still-valid pin fails the run instead), the
    canonical GRANT MAPPING (swapping which secrets flow
    under an existing pin breaks it), and the job's code. Script jobs pin the
    script SPEC, the job ``message``, and the file's current bytes — the
    message is included because a script reads it as its ARGUMENTS
    (``ctx.message``: a channel, a URL, a query) and it is agent-updatable via
    ``cron_update``, so leaving it unpinned would let an approved script be
    re-aimed at an unapproved destination. Command jobs are refused (see
    :func:`_pin_payload`). The digest is
    HMAC-SHA256 under the vault-fenced grant key (see :func:`_grant_pin_key`),
    so a pin cannot be forged by editing the cron store — only the product's
    own grant paths can mint one. Raises
    (FileNotFoundError/PermissionError/ValueError) when the script spec does
    not resolve — a grant must never be minted for code that cannot be read.

    ``body`` lets a caller pin SPECIFIC script bytes it already read: two pins
    derived for one decision (verify the pending, mint the active) MUST come
    from one snapshot, or an agent swapping the file between two reads would
    get code the approver never saw blessed with the active pin.

        # (os.get_exec_path) -- a bare-name wrapper would be redirectable to an
        # attacker binary running BEFORE confinement exists. Pinning belongs in
        # those producers, not here: re-pinning at the spawn site would also
        # rewrite argv[0] on the fail-open no-sandbox path, where argv[0] is the
        # OPERATOR-declared command and silently resolving it against the
        # gateway's own directories would override the very PATH selection the

        # Build the subprocess env: start from the secret-scrubbed cron env, then
        # overlay the per-server `env` block from the agent config (e.g. the PATH
        # that lets a launcher resolve a helper binary it shells out to). A
        # launcher that execs a binary reachable only via that env dies before the
        # initialize handshake if the env is dropped. Three filters apply, and all
        # three are load-bearing:
        #   * _clean_cron_env() strips secrets from the INHERITED env;
        #   * _CRON_ENV_DENY is re-applied to the spec overlay so a denied key
        #     cannot be reintroduced through the config;
        #   * sanitize_spec_env() drops loader/interpreter-injection keys
        #     (LD_*, DYLD_*, and the specific PYTHONPATH/HOME/STARTUP/USERBASE
        #     startup channels -- see env._SPEC_ENV_DENIED_PREFIXES; it is a prefix
        #     set, NOT all of PYTHON*). Those are NOT in _CRON_ENV_DENY, and the spec
        #     env is externally authorable, so without this an `LD_PRELOAD` in a
        #     server's `env` block would be honoured by the dynamic loader inside
        #     the confinement wrapper process -- executing attacker code before
        #     the wrapper establishes containment. Pinning argv[0] does not help:
        #     the loader acts on the pinned binary. This is the same reason
        #     mcp_discovery routes its probe's spec env through the sanitizer;
        #     PATH is deliberately NOT denied, since forwarding it is the point.
        #   * sanitize_spec_env() ALSO drops the reserved KIROCREW_ namespace
        #     (env._SPEC_ENV_RESERVED_PREFIXES), which is an authorization control
        #     rather than a containment one and is the reason the two other filters
        #     are not sufficient here. The server this bridge most often spawns is
        #     `kirocrew-cron` itself, whose ownership checks resolve the calling
        #     session from KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY / KIROCREW_HOST_PID when no
        #     gateway caller block is present -- so one of those in that server's
        #     `env` block would let a SCRIPT CRON name itself another session and
        #     reach that session's jobs. Sandboxing does not bound that:
        #     confinement limits what the child may touch, not whose jobs Kiro
        #     Crew thinks it owns. The deny lives in the shared sanitizer rather
        #     than in _CRON_ENV_DENY so the discovery probe -- which applies no

    An app ships its cron script inside its OWN tree, so a bundle script's
    resolved path lands outside ``crons/`` by construction. Two kinds of root
    provide bundles, matching the two sources
    ``apps.bridges._registration_source`` reads a manifest from:

    * the BUILTIN manifest sources, which is where a shipped builtin's bundle
      lives, and which the bridge deliberately reads builtins from so a mutable
      installed directory cannot borrow a builtin's name.
    * ``<config_dir>/apps``, a third-party app's installed snapshot.

    The builtin leg delegates to ``apps.execution._builtin_manifest_sources``,
    the SAME function ``shipped_builtin_app_root`` walks to CHOOSE a builtin's
    root, rather than assuming that root is under this package. It is not: that
    function also returns the active edition's
    ``apps_loader.manifest_sources()``, which can sit anywhere. One authority for
    both ends is what keeps registration and fire time in agreement -- the
    registrar is handed a builtin's chosen root as ``app_root``, and the
    context-free consumers must recognise that same root, or a cron registers and
    is then refused when it fires. The package directory stays as a fallback for a
    composition where the platform seam is not available, which is how
    ``_builtin_manifest_sources`` itself degrades.

    Deliberately NOT delegated to ``skills._trusted_skill_roots``, which today
    computes a similar set for app-shipped SKILLS. The sets overlap by
    coincidence, not by rule: a skill is prose the scanner reads, a cron script
    is code the launcher executes, and the two admit different things (a skill
    root holds a directory tree with ``SKILL.md``, a script root holds a ``.py``
    file). Sharing one helper would let a future change to which trees may
    supply ``SKILL.md`` silently change which files are EXECUTABLE as crons, in
    a module whose tests would not run.

    Imports are function-local because ``cron_script`` is imported by
    ``mcp_cron``, which ``apps.bridges`` imports back, so a module-level edge
    into the apps package would close that cycle.

    Format: ``"<path>.py:function"``. Default behaviour is the OPERATOR
    contract, byte for byte: a relative path resolves against the process CWD,
    and the resolved file must sit under ``<config_dir>/crons/``. ``cron_add``,
    the CLI and the vault-grant paths pass neither keyword, so nothing below
    reaches them.

    An app cron's script legitimately lives in the app's own bundle rather than
    in ``crons/``, and the two keywords are how a caller says so. They are
    separate because they answer different questions, and each opens one root.

    ``app_root`` says "this spec belongs to THIS app", and is passed where a
    manifest's own spec is vetted (``apps.bridges``, ``apps.cron_sdk``). It
    becomes the base a RELATIVE spec resolves against, because ``"job.py:run"``
    means "next to my manifest" and is the only spelling an app can write
    without knowing its install location. With no base that resolved against
    whatever directory the gateway process happened to start in, naming a file
    that was never there. Containment is that ONE bundle, so app A cannot name a
    script inside app B's tree.

    ``allow_bundle_roots`` says "this spec was ALREADY vetted and persisted",
    and is passed only by the consumers that re-resolve a stored ``job.script``
    holding no app context: the fire-time governance gate, the launcher, and the
    dashboard's script-source endpoint. Containment is the shared bundle roots,
    because a stored absolute bundle path is all those callers have to go on. It
    widens no authoring path: a freshly authored spec must still be under
    ``crons/``, so ``cron_add`` cannot register a script inside a bundle.

    A bundle root accepts ``.py`` files only, under either keyword. That is a
    containment control rather than a style rule, and the surface it guards is
    EXECUTION: the launcher puts the resolved file's directory on ``sys.path``,
    imports the file as a module and calls ``func_name``, so whatever this
    function returns is a path the gateway will run. A bundle holds more than
    code -- ``.app_secret`` is the app's gateway credential (see
    ``dashboard.token_auth``) and ``data/`` holds app state -- and nothing later
    in the chain re-checks the suffix, so without it a manifest could name any
    bundle file as an entry point and have the launcher try to execute it.
    ``crons/`` keeps no such rule, because it exists only to hold scripts.

    The dashboard's script-source endpoint is NOT part of that reasoning: its
    read stays pinned to ``crons/``, so a bundle path is refused there with
    ``script_read_refused`` whatever its suffix.

    Unchanged on every path: a ``..``-bearing relative spec is refused
    lexically before any join, so the verdict never depends on the host's path
    grammar; ``.resolve()`` runs BEFORE containment, so a link pointing out of a
    trusted root is rejected on its target rather than followed;
    ``is_sensitive_path`` still vets the resolved path; and the body scan
    (``mcp_cron._vet_script_file``) is a separate gate this function does not
    speak for. Vault secret GRANTS stay narrower than all of it: their reader
    (:func:`_read_script_body`) is pinned to ``crons/`` alone and the grant paths
    pass neither keyword, so a bundle script can register and run but can never
    be handed a secret.
