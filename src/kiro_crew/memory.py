The DEFAULT store's index sits in the data-home root, beside ``memory.db``, and
not inside the markdown tree it describes: that is where the snapshot ``memory``
component, ``portability``'s export zip and the remote-sync script all name it.
A NAMED store's index lives inside that store's own directory instead. Which of
the two a store gets is ``memory_stores.memory_index_path_for``'s decision, not
this module's — see docs/system-specs/modules/memory-skills-hooks.md.

        1. Windows UNC gate — purely LEXICAL, evaluated before any syscall
           (``stat``/``glob``/``exists`` on a UNC path is itself the outbound
           SMB credential probe). Mirrors ``hooks.validate_file_path``.
        2. Reparse-point gate — the memory root and history dir must not be
           symlinks or Windows junctions (``lstat``-based check that never
           traverses the link). On Windows the workspace's ANCESTOR chain is
           walked root-first before any leaf lstat runs, because an lstat
           resolves every ancestor even when it does not follow the final
           component. Leaf files get the same check in
           :meth:`_guarded_entry`, so every component of every touched path
