"""MCP server exposing cron tools to kiro-cli.

Runs as ``kirocrew mcp-cron`` — kiro-cli spawns it as a child process
and calls tools via JSON-RPC over stdio (MCP protocol).

Tools:
    cron_list       — list all scheduled jobs
    cron_add        — add a cron job (every/cron/at)
    cron_remove     — remove a job by ID
    cron_remove_all — remove all jobs
    cron_pause      — pause a job
    cron_resume     — resume a paused job
    cron_secret_request — request vault secrets for an owned script cron
                          job (records a PENDING grant; operator approves in
                          the dashboard — this tool never grants)

    A ``cron_add`` ``script`` job points at a file under ``~/.kiro/crew/crons/``
    that the agent itself can write (via its file-write tool) and then register.
    ``resolve_script_path`` validates only the *path*, so without this the body
    is never inspected. An ungranted script runs under ``mode="cc"`` and a
    secret-granted one under ``strict``. ``cc`` hides the credential stores on
    Linux; on macOS it deliberately leaves ``~/.aws`` readable (it is the
    Claude Code provider's tier, and that provider authenticates to Bedrock
    through ``credential_process`` under ``~/.aws``), and Windows has no OS
    sandbox backend at all. So a body that names ``~/.aws/credentials`` or
    ``os.environ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"]`` and POSTs it out is worth refusing
    at storage time rather than relying on one runtime control alone.
    Credential exfiltration -- which a human rubber-stamping the ``cron_add``
    approval prompt would not catch -- is the threat this gate closes.

    The body is PYTHON SOURCE, not a shell command line, so it is scanned only with
    the detectors that are meaningful on source text and are all linear, whole-body
    matches: a credential-path spelling anywhere (``_CRON_CRED_PATH_RE``), a
    protected secret env var by ``$NAME`` or bare name (``_CRON_SECRET_ENV_RE`` /
    ``_CRON_SECRET_NAME_RE``), and an exfiltration URL (``scan_exfiltration_urls``).

    It is deliberately NOT handed to ``is_denied`` or ``is_sensitive_bash_command``.
    Both read their subject with shell grammar -- tool-name globs like ``*git*push*``,
    separator-run collapse (in source a backslash run is an ESCAPE), newline-split
    pipeline stages under a fail-closed budget (every line of a script counted as a
    stage, so ~512 lines is a permanent refusal), ordered-existence ``env | grep``
    rules matching pieces hundreds of lines apart, and a ``find``-grammar parse of
    English docstrings. Each produces a class of false denial on ordinary scripts,
    each closeable only by another layer of AST analysis in
    ``security.py``, and ~1500 lines of that still cannot stop
    ``open(os.environ["LOCALAPPDATA"] + r"\\kiro-cli\\config.json")``: static text
    analysis of a Turing-complete body cannot be the fence. The runtime control for
    what a script may OPEN is the sandbox ``run_script`` spawns it in (``wrap_argv``
    bind-masks the crew home's credential leaves, the vault and the keystone in
    ``cc`` mode, and ``strict`` for a secret-granted run); this gate stops the
    obvious register-a-malicious-script case and nothing more. Destructive-op risk is covered by the required ``cron_add``
    approval prompt.

    ``_vet_script_file`` keeps its own ``is_sensitive_path`` on the resolved path.

# ownership filter every MCP cron tool applies -- a non-owner sharing one data home
# would see every participant's job metadata. ``cron-history`` is masked outright,
# and on Linux the mask is an empty writable directory, so a direct read reports
# zero runs for every job and looks identical to a job that has never fired.
#
# So both reads come through here: ownership is decided from the gateway-vouched
# session key, and history is fetched from the gateway for the ALREADY-SCOPED ids
# only. A history read that cannot happen is reported as unavailable, never as zero.

#: Recent runs asked of the gateway per job. Matches the audit window the
#: cron-cost-optimize skill reasons over.

#: characters -- almost three times the response ceiling. Measured, not estimated.
#: Crossing that ceiling matters more than losing a row, because
#: ``sanitize_response`` truncates with a blind tail slice that appends a notice

    holds back ``send_*`` and every ``session_*`` verb for exactly that reason.
    Scheduling a cron job is the same shape made durable: ``cron_add`` takes an
    ``agent`` and ``approval_mode`` that flow straight to ``add_job``, so a
    channel agent could schedule ``agent="kirocrew", approval_mode="auto"`` and
    have a full-tool agent run on the gateway host on a timer -- an escalation
    past its own confinement that outlives both the turn and the channel.
    ``cron_update`` maps ``agent`` onto ``agent_id``, so it re-targets the agent
    of a job the calling session already owns.

    The interactive guard in ``channel.py`` rejects blocked tools at the
    permission-request event, but an AUTO-APPROVED call fires no such event: an
    ``@kirocrew-cron/cron_add`` entry in a channel agent's ``allowedTools`` is

#: Whether this server advertises ``kirocrew.caller-identity`` -- i.e. whether it

#: goes through :func:`_authz_session_key`, whose first source is that block.

#: Advertising is not cosmetic. ``mcp_gateway/backend.py`` strips any client-forged

#: never arrives, and this server's resolver reads an empty identity no matter how
#: correctly it is written. Nothing declines to POOL an unadvertised backend
#: (``rewriter.UNPOOLABLE_SERVERS`` is empty and documents that the capability is
#: read only to decide injection), so the unadvertised state was not "per-session
#: spawn" -- it was pooled AND identity-blind.
