# bounded, and a full pass over N rows touches at most 2N entries (one for the
# key, one for the value).
#
# The bound is in ENTRIES, so it does not bound bytes: an entry retains the text

# Measured retention per entry — ~2.3 KiB for a 120-char value, ~39 KiB for a

#
# A bound BELOW the scan width is worse than no cache at all: a repeated full-table
# scan is LRU's worst case, so once 2N exceeds the bound every access evicts the
# entry the next one needs and the hit rate is not merely degraded but exactly

        attribute missing from ``__init__`` is an ``AttributeError``, but one missing
        from ``init()`` leaves its V1 SPELLING on a crew file — and while a wrong
        RELATION raises "cannot modify a view", a wrong GUARD raises nothing at all and
        simply reaches rows of the other kind.

        per-prompt similarity search, so the carve is the only thing that can
        bound which episodes a query is even allowed to surface.

        ``preserve_existing`` rejects similarity and capacity conflicts instead
        of tombstoning an active entry. Import paths use it to remain merge-only,
        and so does any writer that passes ``defer_embedding``: with no vector the
        similarity dedup below cannot run, and a row admitted without it must not
        evict one it was never compared against.

        ``defer_embedding`` stores the row with a NULL embedding instead of
        embedding inline, leaving it for :meth:`backfill_missing_embeddings`.
        Inference cost grows steeply with text length (~0.4s per 2000-char chunk
        on CPU), so a bulk writer such as the onboarding importer would hold its
        caller for minutes. The row is FTS5 keyword-searchable immediately, and
        becomes semantically searchable once the sweep fills it in. Only for
        callers that schedule that sweep — a row left NULL forever is silently
        absent from vector search. Deferral also skips the similarity dedup
        (which needs a vector), so the caller keeps its own duplicate check.

        numpy is an optional accelerator here rather than a declared dependency,

        With numpy, the scoring columns are held resident between calls

        two searches with no write in between, and redoing it dominated the call:
        the population read and the per-row candidate build were together ~94% of
        it, against ~6% for the mat-vec. The per-call read below stays as the
        path for a store too large to hold and for a library with no
        ``data_version`` pragma.

        Every numpy rung dots in float32, matching the stored dtype and the FAISS
        path, so the resident tier and the per-call read cannot hand the same
        query two different cosines — and that number is not only a ranking key,

        """Write a lesson as a semantic entry with key lesson.<hash>.

        Returns which outcome occurred (see :class:`LessonWriteOutcome`) rather than a
        bare ``bool``, whose ``False`` conflated "validation refused this", "a dedup
        rule claimed it", "it is already stored exactly as submitted" and "your bare
        re-submit kept the stored clause" -- four facts a caller cannot act on without
        telling them apart. The result's TRUTH VALUE is still the old predicate (see
        :class:`LessonWriteResult`), so a caller that only needs "did this write
        something" keeps using ``if store.write_lesson(...)`` unchanged.

        Deduplicates against existing lessons:
        - Substring match: if existing contains new (or vice versa), longer wins
        - Topic overlap: if the shared significant words are >=50% of the LARGER of
          the two keyword sets, newer replaces older
        - Semantic similarity: if >85% cosine similarity, newer replaces older --
          unless a stored near-duplicate outranks this write (``user_explicit``
          over a lower-authority source, or strictly higher stored confidence),
          which reports ``deduped`` / ``semantic_similarity``.

        **A call that stores nothing deletes nothing.** Every supersede the scan
        decides on is QUEUED, and the queue drains only once ``set_semantic`` has
        committed the submission. So a ``deduped`` verdict from any branch, and a
        ``refused`` from the store's own validation, each preserve every live lesson
        row and report an empty ``superseded``. They are not byte no-ops on the
        database: a lazy embedding backfill for a row this call READ may already have
        been flushed, which changes a vector and no lesson.

        Draining after the commit puts the two outcomes in the safe order, and leaves
        one window it cannot close: a drain that stops partway -- a raised error, a
        killed process -- keeps the submission and leaves the rows it had not reached
        yet. That direction is deliberate. The residue is a duplicate, never a lost
        lesson, and the next write matching those rows retires them.

        Two of those three rules DELETE a stored lesson, and the substring rule's
        "longer wins" direction means a submitted rule can retire a stored one that
        is more general than it -- attaching a condition to a rule makes the text
        longer and the guidance NARROWER, so the row that survives can be the one
        that applies less often. That is the designed behaviour and this method
        keeps it: the
        alternative is a store that accumulates near-identical rules, which is what
        these three rules exist to prevent, and the onboarding import already shows
        the sanctioned way to opt out of it (route to ``set_semantic_if_absent``,
        which cannot replace anything -- see ``onboarding_import``).

        What it does NOT keep is the silence. Every rule that deletes records the
        rule text it removed in :attr:`LessonWriteResult.superseded`, so a caller is
        never handed a bare ``inserted`` for a call that destroyed a lesson the
        user still wanted. The result is the only place that can carry this: the
        deleted row is a tombstone, so it is gone from ``get_lessons``, from
        ``learn_list`` and from the injected lessons block by the time the caller
        looks.

        Pass ``rule_emb`` to reuse an embedding already computed by the caller
        and avoid a second blocking embed of the identical text. A caller doing
        that MUST also read :attr:`space_generation` BEFORE it embeds and pass it
        as ``rule_emb_generation``, so a model swap landing between that embed and
        this write is detected and the vector is left NULL for the backfill
        instead of being committed into the wrong space.

        Runtime model-identity assertions and recognized concrete-ID model-selection
        imperatives in either persisted field are refused here, before embedding or
        deduplication. A model-version literal without either form remains durable. The
        JSONL fallback calls the same predicate, so MCP, dashboard, consolidation,
        task-runner, and direct callers share the boundary.

        The sweeps below are the longest-running CPU work the gateway does
        unattended — a migrated memory of a few thousand rows is tens of minutes
        of continuous inference — and to a user that is indistinguishable from a
        runaway process. ``memory.embedding_bulk_duty`` spreads the same total
        work over more wall time by idling between rows (see
        :func:`kiro_crew.embeddings.bulk_pace_delay`).

        The sleep is HERE, on the sweep's own thread, and holds neither the DB
        lock nor the model: an interactive embed arriving mid-pause is served
        immediately. It also deliberately covers a row that failed to embed —
        the delay is derived from measured elapsed time, so a no-op returns 0.0
        and only real work is paced.

        The pause falls between this row's inference and its write, which is what
        makes it safe to interrupt: a sweep killed mid-pause leaves the row's
        ``embedding`` NULL and the next sweep re-embeds it, exactly as it already
        does for every row it never reached.

        *pace* is False for a sweep a human explicitly asked for and is watching
        a progress bar on; slowing that down would be paying the cost with none
        of the benefit, since the load is expected in that case.

        *pace* therefore also selects the scheduling class, because attendance —
        not corpus size — is what both dials are really keyed on. An unattended
        sweep embeds at ``PRIORITY_BULK``, which is what gives it the reduced
        ``memory.embedding_bulk_threads`` pool; an attended one embeds at
        ``PRIORITY_NORMAL`` and so keeps the full interactive pool. Without this,
        ``pace=False`` would switch off the idling but leave the sweep on one
        thread, making the very path this PR declares "full speed" ~3x slower
        than before pacing existed.

        Stored vectors are only comparable to each other when they came from the
        same model at the same dimensionality. Without a record of which model
        produced them, swapping the embedding model corrupts search
        silently: with a different dim the old rows are quietly dropped from the
        index, and with the SAME dim (any other 1024-d model) stale vectors are
        cosine-scored against new-model queries and return meaningless
        similarities.

        This records the active vector space in ``memory_meta`` and, when it
        changes, clears every stored embedding to NULL and drops the FAISS index.
        That deliberately reuses the existing NULL-embedding machinery instead of
        adding a parallel one: :meth:`backfill_missing_embeddings` already
        re-embeds NULL episodic rows in batches and now repairs NULL lesson rows
        alongside them, ``build_faiss_index`` and ``_sqlite_vector_search``
        already skip NULL rows, and FTS keyword search is
        unaffected — so search stays correct (just keyword-only for the affected
        rows) while the re-embed proceeds, and an interrupted run is simply
        resumed by the next sweep.

        The first call on a pre-existing database has no recorded space to compare
        against, and what to do then depends on whether the caller can ATTRIBUTE
        those vectors:

        - ``clear_when_unknown=False`` (default) — the active space is the one
          that produced them (the bundled model), so stamp the signature and
          change nothing. A plain upgrade must not force every user to re-embed
          their whole memory.
        - ``clear_when_unknown=True`` — the caller knows the active space did NOT
          produce them, so they are foreign and get cleared. Callers decide this
          by comparing the active signature against the bundled model's
          (``embeddings.default_embedding_space_signature``), which is provable:
          un-versioned vectors predate custom-model support, so the bundled model
          is the only thing that could have written them. Deciding it that way
          rather than by "is a custom model configured?" covers a model selected
          by config, by env var, or by a programmatic
          ``register_embedding_backend`` alike. Without this the common upgrade
          order — stop, update, point ``embed_model_path`` at a model, start —
          would stamp the NEW signature onto bundled-model vectors and they would
          never be re-embedded.

        A signature that already matches is a no-op unless ``force=True``.
        Explicit model apply uses force to rebuild inherited legacy vectors
        whose old metadata cannot prove which weights produced them.

        with ``write_episodic(defer_embedding=True)`` by a bulk writer such as
        the onboarding importer. Once the model is present and ``embed_fn`` is
        bound, this sweep embeds those rows and adds them to the resident vector
        index so they become semantically searchable.

        Rows cleared by :meth:`reconcile_embedding_space` after an embedding-model
        change arrive here the same way, so a model swap re-embeds through this
        one path rather than a parallel one. Lesson vectors cleared by the same

        which defer embedding to this sweep by design); the returned count stays
        EPISODIC-only, which is what callers report.

        Idempotent and cheap in steady state: a no-op (returns 0) when there is
        no ``embed_fn``, numpy is missing, or no NULL-embedding rows remain.
        Synchronous + blocking (runs model inference) — call from a worker thread
        / executor, never directly on the event loop.

        FAISS is NOT required. It is an optional accelerator and not a declared
        dependency, so gating on it made this sweep a silent no-op on a stock
        install — every deferred row stayed NULL forever. ``search_episodic``
        already falls back to ``_sqlite_vector_search`` (a stdlib cosine scan
        over these blobs), so the stored vectors are useful either way; the
        resident index extension below is simply skipped when faiss is absent.

        *pace* (default on) idles between rows so the sweep targets
        ``memory.embedding_bulk_duty`` of wall time — the same total CPU work
        spread thinner, which is what keeps an unattended post-migration sweep
        from pinning several cores for tens of minutes. It is a target rather
        than a ceiling: a single row whose inference is slow enough to ask for
        more than :data:`~kiro_crew.embeddings._MAX_BULK_PACE_SLEEP` of idle is
        capped there, so that row runs at a higher effective duty. Pass
        ``pace=False`` for a sweep a human explicitly asked for and is waiting
        on. Gateway maintenance can bound each kind with ``max_rows_per_kind``;
        successive visits page past failed rows and wrap for retries. A supplied
