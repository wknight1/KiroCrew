"""The KEYSTONE consent for the decision seam.

Whether Jev may be asked at all lives in ``<config_dir>/decisions_consent.json``,
**not** in ``config.json``. Enabling the seam sends message text and skill
descriptions to an external, paid provider, and ``config.json`` is writable by an
auto-approved agent shell: a prompt-injected agent could set
``decisions.enabled: true`` and the live config watcher would start the egress
without a restart. The precedent is ``aws_service_consent.json`` (consent to spend
the operator's money) and ``computer_use.json`` (consent to drive the desktop):
an authorization goes where the agent cannot write it.

What makes it un-flippable by the agent:

* the leaf is on ``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``, so ``is_sensitive_path`` blocks
  agent reads AND writes on the file-TOOL path; and it is a ``READONLY`` leaf in
  ``sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES``, so the OS sandbox denies every WRITE from the
  agent's shell in every mode. A sandboxed shell can still READ it -- that is the
  documented keystone posture (masking a ceiling would remove it, not protect it),
  and the file holds only a flag and an endpoint, nothing secret;
* the only writer is the browser-only dashboard PUT handler, which does not route
  through the agent tool gate and refuses app tokens;
* every read fails soft to ``{}`` -> **NOT CONSENTED**. A missing, unreadable,
  truncated or hand-mangled file must never mean "send".

The ``decisions`` section of ``config.json`` keeps the knobs that grant nothing on
their own -- the sampling share and the provider -- so there is exactly one place
the seam can be switched on.

Consent is bound to a DESTINATION. ``provider.endpoint`` lives in ``config.json``
too, so a switch that only said "yes" would let the same prompt-injected shell
redirect consented messages to an endpoint it controls. The keystone therefore
records the endpoint the owner consented to, and the gate sends only while the
configured endpoint still equals it; a changed endpoint is a refusal until the
owner consents again through the dashboard.

STATE_KEY_ENABLED = "enabled"
STATE_KEY_ENDPOINT = "endpoint"
#: The prior-conversation budget the owner reviewed, in characters. A CEILING, not
#: the value in force: ``config.json`` still names what to use, and the gate takes
#: the smaller of the two. It lives here because ``config.json`` is agent-writable,
#: so a budget recorded only there could be raised by the very agent whose
#: conversation would be sent -- the same argument that put ``endpoint`` here.
STATE_KEY_HISTORY_BUDGET = "history_budget_chars"

#: Whether the owner consented to sending TOOL-CALL ARGUMENTS, the category
#: ``tool.risk`` needs and ``skills.select`` does not. A separate leaf rather than a
#: wider reading of ``enabled``, for the reason the history ceiling is one: consent
#: is recorded against the text the owner reviewed -- a message excerpt and skill
#: descriptions -- so a record written before this key existed authorizes exactly
#: that and nothing more. Absent reads as NOT consented, which is what keeps every
#: such record meaning what its owner agreed to.
STATE_KEY_TOOL_ARGS = "tool_args"

#: Whether the owner consented to sending the TEXT OF RECALLED MEMORIES, the
#: category ``memory.recall`` needs and no other point does. A separate leaf for
#: exactly the reason ``tool_args`` is one, and the category is genuinely new: a
#: message excerpt is text the owner just typed and a skill description is text this
#: build shipped, while a recalled memory is text the AGENT wrote down turns or days
#: ago about whatever it was working on then. Consent recorded against the first two
#: cannot stand for the third, so absent reads as NOT consented.
STATE_KEY_MEMORY_TEXT = "memory_text"

#: "Keep whatever ceiling is recorded" for :func:`save_enabled`. A distinct object,
#: because ``0`` is a ceiling an owner may choose and no number can mean "not asked".
#: Resolved inside the read-modify-write, so the value written comes from the same
#: read the write is based on: a caller that resolved it first would hold a ceiling
#: read before another writer lowered it, and hand that stale number back.
KEEP_HISTORY_BUDGET: object = object()

#: "Keep whatever tool-argument scope is recorded", on the same terms. A distinct
#: object for the same reason: ``False`` is a scope an owner may choose, so no
#: boolean can also mean "not asked", and it is resolved inside the lock so an
#: enabling PUT cannot restore a scope a concurrent revoking PUT just cleared.
KEEP_TOOL_ARGS: object = object()

#: "Keep whatever recalled-memory scope is recorded", on the same terms and for the
#: same reason as :data:`KEEP_TOOL_ARGS`: ``False`` is a scope an owner may choose,
#: so no boolean can also mean "not asked", and it is resolved inside the lock so an
#: enabling PUT cannot restore a scope a concurrent revoking PUT just cleared.
KEEP_MEMORY_TEXT: object = object()

#: "Keep the consent state that is recorded" for :func:`save_enabled`, for a caller
#: writing only a SCOPE. A scope switch says nothing about whether the seam may send,
#: so a scope-only PUT must not carry a verdict on that: even the value the caller just
#: read is a write against a switch the owner did not touch, and a read taken before a
#: concurrent revoking PUT would assert a consent that had been withdrawn. Resolved
#: inside the writer's own lock like its siblings, and it preserves the recorded
#: ENDPOINT with the flag, because consent is bound to an address and a keystone
#: carrying the flag without one permits nothing.
KEEP_ENABLED: object = object()

# Owner-only: the file records a security decision.
_STATE_FILE_MODE = 0o600

#: Serializes :func:`save_enabled`'s read-modify-write. The handler runs it on a
#: thread, so two owner PUTs genuinely interleave, and resolving
#: :data:`KEEP_HISTORY_BUDGET` from this function's own read only narrows that --
#: it cannot order two reads against one write. Without the lock the enable PUT
#: writes back a ceiling the lowering PUT had already reduced, which raises an
#: egress limit by losing a race. One writer exists in-process, so a thread lock
#: is the whole boundary.

    Enabling records the endpoint the owner is consenting to -- the caller passes
    the one currently configured, so the keystone says where the messages will go
    at the moment consent is given. Disabling clears it, so a later re-enable
    cannot inherit a stale destination. Read-modify-write so an unknown key an
    operator added by hand survives. Raises :class:`ConsentCorruptError` rather
    than clobbering a corrupt file, and ``OSError`` on a write failure, so the
    HTTP handler can report a real error.

    *history_budget_chars* is the prior-conversation ceiling the owner reviewed, and
    it is recorded on the same terms as the endpoint: written on enable, cleared to
    0 on disable so a later re-enable cannot inherit a budget nobody re-reviewed.
    Its default is 0, so a caller that does not mention prior turns consents to none.

    Pass :data:`KEEP_HISTORY_BUDGET` to leave a recorded ceiling as it is. It is
    resolved from THIS function's own read, not the caller's, so the number written
    comes from the same state the write is based on. A caller that read the ceiling
    first and passed the number would hold a value read before a concurrent writer
    lowered it, and handing that back would restore a ceiling somebody just reduced --
    raising an egress limit by losing a race.

    Resolving it here is necessary and not sufficient: the handler runs this on a
    thread, so two owner PUTs interleave and one read still lands before the other's
    write. :data:`_SAVE_LOCK` is held across the read AND the write, which is what
    makes the paragraph above true rather than merely narrow -- the lowering PUT's
    ceiling survives the enable PUT that ran beside it, whichever order they took.

    *tool_args* is the TOOL-ARGUMENT egress scope, recorded on exactly those terms:
    written on enable, cleared on disable so a re-enable cannot inherit a scope
    nobody re-reviewed, and defaulting to ``False`` so a caller that does not
    mention tool arguments consents to none. :data:`KEEP_TOOL_ARGS` leaves a
    recorded scope alone and is resolved inside the same lock, so an enabling PUT
    cannot hand back a scope a revoking PUT had already cleared.

    *memory_text* is the RECALLED-MEMORY egress scope and behaves identically, down
    to :data:`KEEP_MEMORY_TEXT` and the lock. The two scopes are independent fields
    because they are independent decisions: an owner may want risky tool calls
    flagged without the contents of their memory store leaving the machine, and
    either order of those two answers has to be recordable.

    Pass :data:`KEEP_ENABLED` to write a SCOPE without saying anything about consent
    itself. The recorded flag and the recorded endpoint are both left as they are, from
    this function's own read inside the lock, so a scope write cannot assert a consent
    state -- not even the one its caller had just read, which is the stale value a
    concurrent revoking PUT makes wrong. *endpoint* is ignored in that mode, since the
    address is part of what is being preserved.
