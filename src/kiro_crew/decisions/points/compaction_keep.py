"""``compaction.keep`` -- at an AUTO compaction, which tool calls would Jev keep?

A SHADOW measurement, and nothing else. Jev decides nothing: the compaction that
triggered this point runs exactly as it does without the seam, on every backend,
and the answer becomes a row in the decision log plus one line on the compaction
card. :func:`score_compaction` has no apply path and no return value a caller
branches on -- that is what makes it safe to place on the compaction path at all.
What it buys is the number the live design cannot be argued about without: how
much of a real transcript an oracle would keep, against what today's recycle
replay keeps.

Why this point exists in shadow rather than live
-----------------------------------------------
Nothing in Kiro Crew can replace a harness's message list -- no backend offers a
set-messages call, and ``/compact`` summarizes inside the harness process. The one
place a keep-list COULD land is the transcript Crew re-injects after a recycle
(``context.build_session_replay``), and today that replay admits ``user`` /
``assistant`` / ``inject`` rows only (``context.RECALL_ROLES``): every tool call
and every tool result is already dropped. So a live keep-list would only ever
DISPLACE text inside the same 80 000-character budget, and whether that trade is
worth making is a question about data nobody has yet. This point produces that
data and changes no byte of the replay.

Where it runs, and where it deliberately does not
-------------------------------------------------
``session_compaction.CompactionCoordinator._compact_session``, at the top, as a
background task. That method is the ONE funnel both automatic entry points reach
-- the per-turn threshold trigger (``check_context_usage`` ->
``_trigger_compaction``) and the awaited between-turn one (``compact_if_needed``)
-- and it is reached BEFORE the Claude arm, before ``_recycle_unmanaged`` and
before ``_compact_in_place``, so every backend is covered and the scoring never
sits between the trigger and the compaction.

A MANUAL ``/compact`` is excluded, and by construction rather than by a flag: the
dashboard dispatches that command as an ordinary turn through
``provider.stream_command("/compact")`` and never calls ``_compact_session``, so
there is no manual path for this point to be on. A person who typed the command
is not being measured.

It cannot delay or alter the compaction
---------------------------------------
The task is created and NOT awaited. The compaction proceeds on its own
coroutine, and the only thing the deadline below decides is whether this task
gives up. When it does, it logs and publishes nothing, which is the same outcome
as "the seam is off": no card line. So the worst case this point can produce is a
missing observation.

What leaves the machine, and the third consent that authorizes it
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The whole slot transcript, at the fitting stage below: user and assistant text,
every tool-call input redacted and clipped, and every tool RESULT replaced by
``ok, N chars (omitted)`` -- results are never sent, only their sizes. That is a
category neither of the keystone's existing scopes covers: ``tool_args`` was
reviewed as the arguments of the one call about to run, not as everything the
session has run, in a request one to two orders of magnitude larger. So this point
needs a THIRD scope, ``consent.STATE_KEY_COMPACTION``, which absent reads as NOT
consented (``gate.POINTS_NEEDING_COMPACTION``, refused by
``gate._scope_consented``). An install that consented before this scope existed --
including one that granted ``tool_args`` -- is INERT here rather than retroactively
signed up.

Fitting, and the ~8% that never fits
------------------------------------
A real transcript is far larger than an oracle state: 87% of it is tool traffic,
and the p50 session at the 70% compaction threshold carries 198 tool calls over
510 000 characters. :data:`STAGES` walks the spike's measured ladder -- inputs at
1000, then 200, then 60 characters, then the conversation text cut to head+tail
halves, then calls rendered on one line -- and the FIRST stage under
:data:`STATE_TOKEN_CEILING` is the one sent. About one session in twelve does not
fit even at the last stage; that one writes an :data:`ERROR_TOO_LARGE` row and
sends nothing, so the population that cannot be measured is visible instead of
silently absent.

Batching, because the questions outnumber the state
---------------------------------------------------
One ``Choice`` per non-pinned call is hundreds of questions on a real transcript,
and one request carrying all of them would exceed the provider's own ceiling. They
are split into requests of :data:`QUESTIONS_PER_REQUEST`, each carrying the SAME
state, run at most :data:`MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` at a time. Every request is an
ordinary ``decide`` call, so each one is scrubbed, bounded and logged by the gate
on its own.

A PARTIAL answer publishes nothing. The card line is a fraction -- "23 of 61" --
and a fraction over a denominator some of whose members were never asked about is
a false number, not an incomplete one. The outcome row is still written, with
:data:`ERROR_PARTIAL`, so the refusal rate is measurable.

    ``limit=None`` redacts without clipping, which is what a conversation message
    gets: the brief is that user and assistant text travels verbatim, and the stage's
    own ``text_share`` is what cuts it afterwards. A NUMBER would have to be a guess
    at how much a redactor lengthens the text -- a placeholder is longer than most
    secrets -- so a message whose secret was replaced would lose real characters off
    its end to a bound that was only ever meant to be "as long as it was".

    Redaction, not the gate's refusal, and the difference is the same one
    ``tool_risk.scrubbed`` states: the gate REFUSES a request carrying a credential,
    which is right for text a caller chose to send, while a credential in a tool
    argument is ORDINARY -- an ``aws`` command, a curl header -- so refusing on it
    would mean the point never fires on the transcripts most worth measuring.
    Replacing it keeps the state describable and leaves nothing to leak, and the
    gate's own scan still runs over the result.

    Through :func:`~kiro_crew.platform.context.redact_via_context`, the canonical
    egress shim, and NOT through ``security.redact_credentials`` alone. That
    baseline knows only the patterns this repository ships; a host that loaded a
    companion has its own credential and cookie spellings, and a baseline-only pass
    would send those verbatim to a third party. The shim routes through
    ``current_context().credentials.redact`` so a companion's patterns apply, and a
    standalone process gets byte-for-byte the baseline. Exfiltration URLs are
    cleared by the shipped pass on top, because ``redact`` covers credentials.

    Clipped AFTER redaction, never before: a cut placed inside a secret leaves a
    fragment neither pattern matches, and the fragment is what would go on the wire.
    The clip is a HEAD, unlike ``message_steer.redacted``'s tail, because the
    identifying part of a tool input is its beginning -- the command, the path --
    not its end.

    Never raises, INCLUDING on a composition failure. The shim deliberately
    re-raises ``PlatformCompositionError`` so a host that could not compose its
    companion cannot silently downgrade to the baseline; here that is caught and the
    FIELD IS DROPPED, which is the same direction the rest of this function fails in
