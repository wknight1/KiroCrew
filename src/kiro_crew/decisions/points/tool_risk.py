"""``tool.risk`` -- how risky is the tool call this session is about to run?

An ANNOTATION, and nothing else. The permission DECISION is not consulted and not
altered: the answer becomes a badge on the tool card and a row in the decision
log, and a call the policy allows is still allowed with the tier ``risky`` on it,
while a call the policy refuses is still refused with ``safe`` on it. That is the
whole contract, and it is the reason this point may run at all -- an oracle answer
is an observation, and an observation must never become a gate.

Two things the contract does NOT claim, because neither is true. It is not free of
TIMING: the caller awaits this point in the ``tool_call`` branch, which the harness
sends BEFORE it asks for permission, so a sampled call's approval is answered up to
the wait budget later than it otherwise would be. And a badge is not a verdict on
whether the call ran -- a host gate, a ``PreToolUse`` hook or a batch cascade can
refuse a call that already carries one, and the SEL tool-invocation audit is where
that outcome is recorded. What is unchanged is the decision itself: same inputs,
same branches, same answer.

Why it only runs where nothing asks the human
---------------------------------------------
The caller gates on the session AUTO-APPROVING its tool calls (``trust`` or
YOLO). In a session that prompts, the human reads the call and is the
annotation; adding a second opinion to a card they are already judging would be
noise beside a control. In a trusting session nothing stops to describe what is
about to run, so a badge is the only signal there is, and the only place a reader
learns that the seam looked at all.

What ``policy`` on the row means, and what it deliberately does not
------------------------------------------------------------------
``policy`` is the grant that answers this call -- ``yolo``, ``trust`` or
``trust_scope``, the caller's own descriptive spelling. It is NOT a per-call
verdict, and it cannot be: the harness sends the ``tool_call`` notification
BEFORE it asks for permission (``acp/_dispatch.permission_event``, "the preceding
``tool_call`` notification"), so the card this record rides exists before any
verdict about it does. A later refusal -- a host gate, a ``PreToolUse`` hook, a
batch cascade -- is recorded by the SEL tool-invocation audit, which is where a
per-call outcome already lives. Putting a guess at it here would give the log two
descriptions of one call and make the weaker one look authoritative.

A SECOND consent, not a wider reading of the first
-------------------------------------------------
This point sends a category ``skills.select`` never did -- the tool's name and its
arguments -- so consent to send is not consent to send this. The keystone records
the two separately (``consent.consented_tool_args``), absent reads as NOT
consented, and ``gate._scope_consented`` refuses the point without it. An install
that consented before the scope existed is therefore INERT here rather than
retroactively signed up, which is the same argument that gave
``history_budget_chars`` a keystone ceiling instead of a config value.

Everything is a refusal back to "no badge"
------------------------------------------
:func:`risk_record` returns ``None`` for: the seam off, the session unsampled, the
tool-argument scope not consented to, the turn cap reached, a scrubbed or failed
call, an unusable answer, and a ``safe`` verdict. So an ordinary tool card is byte-identical to the one this
build appends today, and a caller needs no try/except and no feature check.

``safe`` is a refusal to BADGE, not a refusal to record: the row is written with
``tier="safe"``, because "the seam looked and thought it was fine" is the answer
that makes the other two readable, and a badge on every card would cost the
annotation its meaning.

Two bounds, because a turn can call many tools
---------------------------------------------
One oracle call per tool call, and at most :data:`MAX_CALLS_PER_TURN` per turn.
The wait is the same shape every point uses (``timeout_secs`` plus
:data:`WAIT_MARGIN_SECS`, clamped into :data:`MIN_WAIT_SECS` ..
:data:`MAX_WAIT_SECS`); the per-turn cap is what keeps a tool-heavy turn from
spending that budget twenty, or two hundred, times over. The call that CROSSES
the cap writes one row saying so, so a reader can tell "this turn stopped being
annotated" from "this turn was never sampled"; the calls after it write nothing.
