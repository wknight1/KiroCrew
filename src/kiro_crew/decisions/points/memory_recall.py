"""``memory.recall`` — which recalled memories are worth the prompt?

The shipped recall is vector similarity: ``VectorMemoryStore.search_episodic``
scores every live episode against the turn's message, drops what falls under the
length-aware cosine gate, and the top-k survivors are formatted into the
episodic-memory block ``get_episodic_context`` returns. Similarity is the only
judgement made — a memory that is ABOUT the same words as the message is admitted
whether or not it helps with the work, and the block is paid for out of
``_EPISODIC_MEMORY_CAP`` on every fresh session.

This point asks the oracle the second question, per candidate: keep this one, or
drop it. Jev's kept set is what gets injected.

Two halves, deliberately split by thread
----------------------------------------
:func:`kept_memories` is synchronous and runs on the caller's thread —
``ContextBuilder.build_session_context`` is sync and production reaches it only
through ``build_message`` on ``run_in_embed_pool``, a thread executor. The
redaction of each snippet, the consent read and the outcome row all happen on
that worker thread, never on the event loop that serves the gateway. Only the
``decide`` await is submitted to the loop, and the caller waits for a bounded
budget. Same shape, same reason, as ``points/skills_select.py``.

A SECOND consent, because this is a new category
-----------------------------------------------
A recalled memory is not the text the main switch describes. That consent is
recorded against a message excerpt -- text the owner just typed -- and skill
descriptions, which this build shipped. A recalled memory is text the AGENT wrote
down turns or days ago, about work the owner was not reviewing when they flipped
the switch. So the keystone records a scope of its own, ``memory_text``
(``consent.consented_memory_text``), default FALSE, and ``gate.POINT_EGRESS_SCOPES``
refuses this point without it -- which means an install consented before the scope
existed is INERT here rather than retroactively signed up. The refusal arrives as
``core.is_enabled`` answering False, so it costs no redaction and writes no row,
exactly like an unsampled turn: the three cheap refusals touch no disk by design.

Everything is a REFUSAL back to the baseline
--------------------------------------------
:func:`kept_memories` returns ``None`` for "inject exactly the similarity top-k"
— the point is off, this session is not sampled, this is not an owner dashboard
turn, the candidate list is empty, the answer is unusable, the transport failed,
the budget expired, or there is no usable loop. It returns a LIST only for a real
answer, and that list may legitimately be empty: "none of these are worth the
prompt" is an answer, not a failure.

Only a SUBSET, never a re-ranking and never a widening
------------------------------------------------------
The candidates are exactly the rows similarity already chose, in the order it
chose them, and the answer can only remove some of them. Two reasons. The block's
order is the ranker's, and a keep/drop answer says nothing about order, so
reordering on it would discard a judgement for one that was never made. And
widening would mean offering rows the relevance gate already refused, which is a
different question (is this relevant at all) asked of a model that is not holding
the embeddings.

Both arms, every sampled turn
-----------------------------
The baseline arm is the candidate list itself, so knowing what similarity would
have injected costs nothing. Jev's kept set is what gets injected; the baseline is
recorded beside it with ``agree``, the mean keep probability and the characters
the narrower block saves. There is no shadow mode: the arm that is injected is
always Jev's.

#: One recalled-memory row, as whatever mapping type the caller holds.
#:
#: A TypeVar rather than a plain ``Mapping[str, Any]`` because this point returns a
#: SUBSET OF THE SAME OBJECTS it was handed -- the identity contract
#: ``vector_memory._kept_episodes`` judges membership on. Saying ``Mapping`` would
#: throw that away and hand a ``list[dict]`` caller back something it could not put
#: where its own rows go, which is exactly the seam the store's ``keep=`` parameter
#: is. So the bound travels with the value: a store passing ``list[dict]`` gets
#: ``list[dict]``, and the type now states what the docstrings promise.
RowT = TypeVar("RowT", bound=Mapping[str, Any])

#: Cap on how many recalled memories are described to the oracle. One question per
#: candidate, so this bounds the request's question count as well as its size. The
#: shipped ``memory.episodic_max_results`` is well under it; a configuration that
#: raised it far higher would have the tail dropped rather than sent.
MAX_CANDIDATES = 20

#: The message excerpt that leaves the machine, same bound ``skills.select`` and
#: ``message.steer`` apply, so one owner reviewed one number.
MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS = 2000

#: How much of each memory is described. A snippet, not the memory: the question
#: is whether this row is worth its place in the block, and the opening of a
#: fragment is what answers it. Applied AFTER redaction — see :func:`scrubbed`.
MAX_SNIPPET_CHARS = 200

#: The two answers one candidate may carry. A Choice rather than a score because
#: ``Choice`` is the only question type ``impl_jev`` speaks; the probability the
#: threshold is applied to is the one the provider reports for the chosen option.

KEEP_OPTIONS = [KEEP_OPTION, DROP_OPTION]

#: Keep probability at or above which a memory reaches the prompt. A CONSTANT, not

#: into a no-op (1.0 drops everything) without turning the seam off.
KEEP_THRESHOLD = 0.5

#: Scheduling slack added to the provider budget, and the floor and ceiling on the

    Runs on the CALLER's thread, which in production is an executor worker. The
    order below is the contract:

    1. this session has no live DASHBOARD SURFACE — refuse, before anything else.
       The receipt for this decision rides a reply someone is looking at, and the
       egress is memory text, so a turn with nobody watching is never asked about:
       a cron, a sub-agent, an integration, and any session whose tab is closed.
       A CHANNEL-born session with its dashboard tab open DOES qualify — the
       publisher contributes each open slot's own key, channel keys included --
       and that is the intended reading rather than an accident: the owner is
       reading that conversation in the dashboard and the strip will reach them
       there;
    2. no usable loop, or this thread is running one — refuse. Waiting on a
       future from the loop's own thread would deadlock the loop;
    3. there are no candidates — refuse. An empty block is what both arms
       produce, so there is nothing to decide;
    4. the point is not enabled for this session — refuse, before any redaction.
       That covers the ``memory_text`` consent scope as well as the switch and the
       sampling bucket, because the gate funnels all three through one keystone
       read;
    5. screen and redact the candidate rows on THIS thread;
    6. submit one round to *loop* and wait ONCE for the whole turn's budget;
    7. record both arms and publish the outcome, still on THIS thread.

    The returned list holds the CANDIDATE ROWS THEMSELVES -- the same objects, not
    copies -- in candidate order, so the caller injects the rows it already had
    rather than re-resolving keys, and so the store's identity-based membership
    check accepts them (see :func:`surviving_rows`).

    A budget expiry cancels the future and returns ``None``. ``cancel()`` cannot
    stop a coroutine that already started, so the guarantee is the stronger one
    available: the result is never read again, so a late answer cannot alter the
