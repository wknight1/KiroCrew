"""Business adapters for the Jev decision seam.

Three adapters. ``skills.select`` picks the skill a message loads: an exact
offered key selects one, an explicit no-skill answer selects none, and a refusal
keeps trigger matching. ``message.steer`` decides whether a message sent into a
RUNNING turn steers it or queues for the next one, and a refusal takes the steer
path the composer has always defaulted to. ``model.route`` answers how hard a
chat turn is and maps that tier to a model id, and a refusal keeps the model the
session was already on. Each adapter's refusal is the shipped behaviour, never a
third outcome.

The core package owns transport, sampling and diagnostic logging.

What lives HERE rather than in one adapter is the prior-conversation read, because
``skills.select`` and ``model.route`` send the same thing under the same ceiling:
the budget comes from ``gate.history_budget_chars`` (the smaller of the config and
the keystone), the rows come from a caller-supplied callable so an unsampled turn
pays for no transcript read, and only ``user`` / ``assistant`` text is ever
projected. A second copy of that walk in the second adapter would be a second
place for the budget to be spent differently, which is the one property the
keystone ceiling exists to make checkable.

Nothing here imports an adapter: the shared helpers are below the points, so a
broken adapter cannot make another one unimportable.

    twice.
