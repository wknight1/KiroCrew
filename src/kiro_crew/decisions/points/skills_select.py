"""``skills.select`` — which skill should this message load?

The shipped selector is word-overlap trigger matching
(``SkillsLoader.get_triggered_skills``, scored by ``trigger_match.trigger_score``
against ``MIN_TRIGGER_OVERLAP``). This point asks the oracle the same question
over a WIDER menu and, when an answer arrives, that answer is what
``build_message`` injects.

Two halves, deliberately split by thread
----------------------------------------
:func:`selected_skills` is synchronous and runs on the caller's thread —
``ContextBuilder.build_message`` is sync and production reaches it only through
``run_in_embed_pool``, a thread executor. Candidate discovery (a skill-tree walk
plus one frontmatter read per skill), the prior-turn read, the body measurement
and the outcome row therefore all happen on that worker thread, never on the
event loop that serves the gateway. Only the ``decide`` awaits are submitted to
the loop, and the caller waits for a bounded budget.

Everything is a REFUSAL back to the baseline
--------------------------------------------
:func:`selected_skills` returns ``None`` for "keep exactly what trigger matching
chose" — the point is off, this session is not sampled, the cap is zero, the menu
is empty, the answer is unusable, the transport failed, the budget expired, or
there is no usable loop. It returns ``[]`` only for a real answer of "no skill
applies", and ``[key]`` for a real pick. A caller needs no try/except of its own.

What the menu is, and is not
----------------------------
Candidates are every skill this message COULD load, not the skills word overlap
already won on: offering only the winners would let the oracle re-rank a
selection and never widen it. The existing RESTRICTIONS all survive, because each
one is a rule about what may reach a prompt rather than a ranking:

* ``always: true`` skills are injected unconditionally and are never selected;
* a skill with no ``triggers`` is not selectable by the baseline either;
* ``repo_scope`` is enforced through the loader's own gate;
* a NEGATIVE trigger that matches this message excludes the skill outright;
* enumeration goes through ``_iter_visible``, so an untrusted project's skills
  are absent and a confined project skill is read through the confined reader;
* the answer must name an offered key EXACTLY, so nothing resolves by prefix;
* the result is capped by the live ``skills.max_triggered``, and a cap of zero
  means no selection and no call at all.

Both arms, every sampled turn
-----------------------------
The word-overlap result is computed from the SAME tree walk that builds the menu
(:func:`candidates_from_loader`, ``baseline_out``), so knowing what the baseline
would have injected costs no second walk and no second frontmatter read. Jev's
answer is what gets injected; the baseline is recorded beside it, with
``agree``, the probability and an estimate of the body characters the difference
saves. That is what makes the log answerable about whether the seam is worth its
latency, and it is the only reason both arms exist here — there is no shadow
mode: the arm that is injected is always Jev's.
