#: Managed servers that advertise ``kirocrew.caller-identity`` AND are safe to

#: injects instead of reading identity from their own process, whose behaviour
#: for a caller the gateway CANNOT name is also pooling-safe (refusal, or a
#: correctly separated namespace). A name absent from this set reads as
#: session-bound: either it does not consume the block at all, or it is in
#: ``_MANAGED_SERVERS_ADVERTISING_BUT_WITHHELD`` below.
#:
#: A NAME SET rather than a runtime read of each module's own constant. Reading the
#: constant means ``importlib.import_module`` on the request path, which executes
#: package code the gateway does not otherwise run -- the package directory is
#: writable by the same uid the agent runs as, so on an editable checkout every
#: MCP-servers request becomes an execution point for whatever was written there.
#: The sibling in-process tool read accepts that cost only on the fallback path
#: where the sandbox could not have confined a spawn anyway; a classification
#: consulted on every render must not widen it to hosts where the sandbox works.
#:
#: The drift this trades for is already covered:
#: ``test/test_mcp_managed_caller_identity.py`` drives each server's real serve
#: entry point and asserts this set matches the ``advertise_caller_identity``
#: argument actually handed to the shim. That check imports the modules in the
#: TEST process, where running package code is the point rather than a hazard.

#: Managed servers that ADVERTISE the capability but are deliberately withheld
#: from ``_MANAGED_SERVERS_CALLER_AWARE`` — advertising is necessary for the
#: not-session-bound classification but not sufficient. ``kirocrew-computer``
#: consumes the injected caller block (its pooled attribution is correct for
#: every caller the gateway can name), but a caller the gateway CANNOT name
#: proceeds under ``unresolved:<pid>`` by product decision — and unnamed is the
#: NORMAL case on macOS, the only platform with a computer-use driver.
#:
#: A per-CONNECTION nonce keeps those unnamed callers from collapsing onto one
#: ``SnapshotIndex`` namespace on a CURRENT gateway. The
#: entry stays because that is not the whole precondition. This set feeds
#: ``managed_server_is_session_bound``, which feeds the shareability verdict,
#: which ``mcp_gateway/seed.py`` turns into a CONFIG WRITE (``recommend_share``
#: -> ``apply_seed``): promoting a name here can switch sharing ON for an
#: operator who never chose it. And the daemon that would then serve those
#: shared frames is not necessarily the one this code shipped with —
#: ``mcp_gateway/manager.py`` ADOPTS whatever healthy daemon already holds the
#: socket, so a gatewayd that outlived a package upgrade keeps running and
#: injects no nonce (which is exactly why ``REGISTERED_CAPABILITIES`` exists).
#: Promotion therefore has to wait until a nonce-blind gateway cannot serve a
#: POOLED computer backend at all — negotiated, not assumed.
#:
#: Contrast ``kirocrew-dashboard``, which refuses an unidentified caller and is
#: therefore safe to classify shareable regardless of the daemon's generation.
#: ``test_mcp_managed_caller_identity.py`` pins this so the entry can neither
#: silently persist past its reason nor silently widen.

    A static header whose value carries a runtime reference is a documented
    form (docs/reference/kiro-cli/mcp/configuration.md) that kiro-cli expands
    at session runtime. Sending the reference as literal text gets the server's
    correct rejection reported as a failing row — with advice to delete a
    header that works in every session.

    Delegates to the mcp_gateway rewriter's declared-env expander — same regex,
    same credential-filtered source view (``is_secret_env_key`` /
    ``is_credential_env_key`` / ``scrub_agent_denied_env`` names are misses),
    same "unresolved stays literal" kiro-cli parity — rather than duplicating
    the policy here: two copies of a credential filter is the drift
    ``is_secret_env_key``'s own docstring warns against. The import is
    function-local because ``mcp_gateway.preflight`` / ``evaluate`` import this
    module at module scope; keeping the rewriter off this module's import graph
    avoids handing every consumer that never probes the rewriter's imports.

    so a scrub set keyed on whole sent values would miss a server echoing only
    the resolved fragment. Each resolved value therefore joins the

    Three-valued on purpose. ``True``/``False`` are observations; **``None`` means
    the question could not be answered**, and the caller must not let that reach
    the payload as ``False``. The distinction is load-bearing: "no grant held" is
    what makes "Sign-in required" honest, so a cache home that cannot be read at
    all — a permission error, a broken mount — degrades to ``None``, and absence
    from the payload renders as the safe "Not verified" instead.

    ``None`` does NOT cover artifact-layout drift, and it is worth being exact
    about that. If kiro-cli re-keys the paths this mirrors, the stat succeeds
    against a path that simply is not there, so ``grant_presence`` returns
    ``False`` and an already-authorized server reads "Sign-in required". That row
    does NOT recover on its own, and a maintainer must not deprioritize the drift
    on the assumption that it does: a second sign-in mints artifacts under the
    NEW key while this keeps stat-ing the old one, so the row goes on asking for
    a sign-in until this mirror is corrected. The recorded-hash tests pin the
    mirror only against itself, so such a change would not fail in-repo either —
    catching it needs an observation of an artifact kiro-cli actually wrote.

    The three-valued answer comes from :func:`mcp_grant.grant_presence`, which the
    persisted connection view resolves through as well -- one spelling of "present,
    absent, or unknowable", so the two surfaces cannot disagree about the same
    artifacts, and neither can lose the middle answer.

    The probe holds no token of its own (Kiro Crew stores no credentials), so the
    runtime's own artifacts are the only evidence available, and they are stat-ed
    for presence, never read. ``mcp_grant`` is a leaf module for exactly that
    reason: the derivation is shared with the mint rather than copied, and it
    carries none of the agent or ACP graph, so this is an ordinary module-scope
    import with nothing deferred to request time.

    ``name`` is what gets logged, never ``mcp_url``: a user-added endpoint can

    Updates server.status and server.tools in place and returns it.

    *client_info* overrides the ``clientInfo`` sent in the handshake. The
    shareability pre-flight uses it to ask the same server twice under two
    identities: a server that negotiates its capabilities from ``clientInfo``
    answers differently, and that is precisely the case a pooled backend cannot
    serve — it caches the first stub's ``initialize`` result and replays it to
    every later stub. Callers that just want status and tools omit it and keep
    the probe's own identity.

    A consent-disabled server is refused HERE, ahead of the local/remote
    dispatch, because probing is the act that runs it: the local branch spawns
    the command and the remote branch opens the connection. Enforcement in each
    caller (``probe_all`` filtering disabled rows before building
    coroutines) would make the guarantee only as good as the newest call
    site's memory — a second entry point would have to restate the check or
    become a way around the consent gate. Keeping the rule in the one function every
