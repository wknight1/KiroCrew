# Kiro Crew user documentation

**These docs ship inside the Python package.** They are the end-user documentation:
in-app reading, dashboard Settings links, and the feature-tips catalog all resolve
here. Contributor and architecture docs live in [`../../../docs/`](../../../docs/README.md).

[index.md](index.md) is the in-app entry point. This README is the same set,
organized for someone browsing the repository.

## Getting started

| [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) | Common problems and fixes. |
| [blocked-commands.md](blocked-commands.md) | Why a command was refused, what the agent is told to do instead, and how to check your credential setup. |

## Platform

| Doc | Covers |
|---|---|
| [mcp-apps.md](mcp-apps.md) | Rendering interactive MCP tool output in chat: the two gates, what a server declares, and the plain-text fallback. |
| [settings-deeplink.md](settings-deeplink.md) | Answering "where is that setting?" with a link that opens and flashes the control, and the generated registry it comes from. |

## Maintaining this directory

Three constraints make this tree different from `docs/`:

- **Filenames are an API.** `tips.py` globs `*.md` here and filters through
  `tips_allowlist.py`, extracting each doc's H1 and first paragraph into the in-app
  feature catalog; dashboard Settings panels hardcode GitHub URLs to specific
  filenames; and a test pins one name. Renaming or deleting a file here is a code
  change, and a doc dropped from the catalog fails silently. `scripts/docs-lint.sh`
  pins the coupled names.
- **The tree is flat, deliberately.** `setup.cfg`'s `package_data` glob for this
  directory does not recurse, so a file in a subdirectory would ship in the sdist
  but be missing from the wheel.
- **Not every file here is prose.** `settings-registry.generated.json` is a build
  artifact of the dashboard (`npm run gen:settings`), shipped beside
  [settings-deeplink.md](settings-deeplink.md) so the agent can enumerate the
  Settings controls at runtime. Do not hand-edit it; a frontend test byte-matches
  it against the live panels.

Because every doc here reaches every user, keep the content task-oriented and free
of internal design narration. An engineering note belongs in
[`../../../docs/`](../../../docs/README.md) instead — for example
[how the model's context is assembled](../../../docs/architecture/context-management.md),
which cites private symbols and so lives there rather than here. Each doc's first paragraph is
read verbatim as a feature description, so write it to stand alone.
