    derives, and a projected view always renames itself to that alias and carries
    no ``skill://`` resource (both are what the projection strips and rewrites).

    Deleting one cannot prove the pair unregenerable the way a recorded work

    re-prepares first -- the spawn argv, and ``session/set_mode``, which re-runs
