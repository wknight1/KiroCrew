"""Supervise the KiroCrew MCP gateway subprocess.

Lifecycle:

1. :meth:`GatewayManager.start` — spawn ``python -m
   kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.gatewayd``, wait until the unix socket appears,
   then round-trip one ping/pong to confirm the daemon is serving.
2. Background watchdog — detect exit and respawn with exponential backoff.
3. :meth:`GatewayManager.shutdown` — SIGTERM → SIGKILL the daemon on
   KiroCrew shutdown.

Gateway failures are non-fatal for KiroCrew. If the daemon crashes, the
stub's graceful-fallback path exec's the real MCP binary directly, so
sessions keep working — the only loss is the RAM sharing benefit until
the daemon recovers.

# ping timeouts (stub kill-storms, socket drains, pool-wide eviction
# cycles) to self-heal without the watchdog tripping and killing a
# daemon that would have recovered on its own. Empirically, the 2-fail
# threshold raced with run_chaos.py and produced spurious
# "gatewayd_pid_changed_unexpectedly" during legitimate chaos tests.
#
# Reaching the threshold takes more than three quiet cycles: a cycle counts only
# when NEITHER probe answered (``_ping_with_escalation``), because the fast bound
# measures load rather than liveness and on its own cannot tell a dead accept
# loop from an event loop that is merely saturated. Under a wide fan-out that

# inside 2s, and because ``_ping_raw`` gives up at its own deadline the manager
# never SEES the late reply — so no amount of evidence in the pong helps unless
# something waits long enough to collect it. That is this probe's whole job. It

        those stems in a stand-down request. Reporting is not refusing, and
        that split is deliberate: this method only MEASURES the drift, and the
        caller decides. Refusing adoption on its own would not help -- gatewayd's
        flock guard makes a competing spawn a clean no-op while the stale daemon
        keeps the socket, so a bare refusal trades a warning for an outage. The

        incumbent to RELEASE the socket first (``_request_stand_down``); only
        then is a competing spawn able to bind.

        Two things still make the un-repaired case safe, and both matter because
        an incumbent may refuse: the gatewayd side answers an unknown target at
        the ensure_backend pre-flight with ``fallback: true``, so a stub degrades
        to a per-session exec instead of dying, and this method's warning makes

        already closed its accept loop, so it is no longer adoptable, whereas one
        that refused is still serving and is.

        Voluntary by design. The starting gateway must not take the endpoint
        itself: :meth:`_clear_stale_socket` is a connect-probe-then-unlink, and
        in its documented false-stale window that unlinks a LIVE incumbent's
        socket -- the socket-theft class the flock guard exists to prevent. Here
        the incumbent runs its own SIGTERM-equivalent drain and removes its own
        endpoint, so there is no stale-vs-live judgement to get wrong.

        ``need`` travels with the request so a daemon that already resolves every
        requested stem can refuse (see ``gatewayd._apply_stand_down``).

        What is waited ON is the singleton LOCK becoming free, not the endpoint
        disappearing, and the difference is load-bearing. A draining daemon stops
        accepting first and releases the lock last, so the endpoint goes away
        while the lock is still held -- on Windows for the daemon's whole drain,
        since the kernel drops a pipe name as soon as the last handle closes. A
        replacement spawned in that gap loses the lock, exits rc=0 without
        binding, and ``_wait_for_socket`` then fails the start with no watchdog
        left to retry. The lock is precisely what the replacement must win, so it
        is the only correct readiness signal.

        Bounded by the daemon's own published shutdown budget, and abandoned as
