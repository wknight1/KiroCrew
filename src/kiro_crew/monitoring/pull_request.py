    One base derivation for all four pull-request kinds: every adapter funnels
    through :func:`build_pull_request_probe_result`, so the conditions come from
    the canonical facts rather than from any provider's response shape. An
    adapter whose evidence streams must stay in separate namespaces keeps them
    apart by CHECK IDENTITY -- the identity a provider puts in ``checks`` is what
    ends up inside ``red:<identity>`` -- so nothing here merges two streams that
    the provider kept apart.

    This is where the representation defect is repaired. ``blocking_review`` is a
    single precedence winner, so a pull request carrying BOTH
    ``changes_requested`` and unresolved review threads records only the first
    and the second is lost before anything can act on it. Here they are two
    conditions, each masked, aged and reset on its own, and both survive.

    Both are ``NEVER``: a review verdict and a review thread belong to the
    conversation, not to the commit under review, so a force-push must not
    replay them. A failing check is the opposite -- it is a property of the
    revision that dispatched it, so a new head genuinely clears it.

    ``conflict`` is the ``IMMEDIATE`` one. A conflicted pull request dispatches
    no checks, so the pending count the coalescing floor waits on never drains,
    and holding the wake would strand the owner for the whole floor on a signal
    that is already actionable. ``behind`` is not urgent in that way: the branch
    still builds, so waiting continues to observe something.

    Conditions are capped, and the cap is on the CHECK expansion alone because it
    is the only unbounded one: the canonical projection already bounds each check
    bucket, and the review conditions are three fixed keys.
