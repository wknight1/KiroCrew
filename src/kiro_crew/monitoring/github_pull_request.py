        GitHub's GraphQL API answers for many pull requests in one document, so
        this BATCHES rather than looping: the subjects of one call share each
        read, and each read costs one request per chunk of at most
        ``_MAX_SUBJECTS_PER_QUERY`` subjects instead of one per subject. A tick of
        any size up to that bound is three requests, and each further chunk adds
        three. Fifty subjects were roughly one hundred and fifty ``gh``
        invocations and are now six, plus one document for each further page a
        subject's rollup or thread list advertises.

        One query carries one identity, and that is checked rather than assumed.
        The credential is this call's argument, so it cannot differ between two of
        its subjects; the host is per subject, so every chunk is checked to name
        one host and the query is refused if it names two, which is what keeps a
        document from reading one host's subjects with another host's token.

        The three reads stay separate because their failures are separate. The
        load-bearing primary read selects no check rollup, so a missing Checks
        permission cannot erase authorized lifecycle facts; each supplemental
        read carries the head revision, so a push mid-tick becomes typed
        incomplete evidence rather than another commit's checks; and a merged or
        closed primary state issues neither supplemental request.

        A subject that cannot be read degrades ALONE. GitHub answers a partial
        failure with the readable subjects populated under ``data`` and the rest
        named in ``errors[].path``, and ``gh`` exits non-zero while still writing
        that ``data`` -- so the exit code is not what decides, and one unreadable
        subject costs the other subjects nothing.

        Keyed by the subject string as passed, so a caller can always look up
        what it asked for.

    to carry one ``name:``, and each may publish a check of the same name, so a label

    A row is exempt whenever the response did not supply one of those, which is the

    The rollup carries no lineage edge: nothing in it states that one run replaced

    one workflow can be an independent dispatch, since a single file may declare
    several triggers and ``WorkflowRun.event`` is coarser than the action that fired
    it -- a ``synchronize`` run and an ``edited`` run share ``pull_request``. So
    recency alone cannot license dropping a row.

    A cancelled RUN is the case where displacement IS established: the concurrency
    group cancelled the run in favour of the one that superseded it. That is a
    property of the run, so it is read from the run and never inferred from the row.
    A row reaches ``CANCELLED`` for reasons that are not supersession at all -- a
    fail-fast matrix cancelling its siblings, a job cancelled because something in
    its ``needs`` failed, an operator cancelling one job -- and in each of those the
    run itself concludes ``FAILURE`` and is entirely live. Treating the row's own
    cancellation as displacement would drop a row out of a live run, and because the
    fold re-runs identically on every poll the loss is silent and never self-corrects.

    Both are required. The run's cancellation is what proves the row was displaced;
    the row's own ``COMPLETED``+``CANCELLED`` is what proves removing it takes no
    verdict with it, since a cancelled run can still contain a row that reached a
    real ``FAILURE`` before the cancel landed. Requiring both drops only a row that

    supersession is the RUN a row belongs to and whether that run was cancelled --
    never the row's own conclusion, which reaches ``CANCELLED`` inside live runs too.

    Newest is the greatest RUN ID, which increases monotonically. Not a timestamp:
    ``WorkflowRun.createdAt`` resolves only to the second, and two runs of one
    workflow on one head routinely share it -- a workflow firing on both
    ``synchronize`` and ``edited`` produces exactly that, both under the
    ``pull_request`` event. Ordering on it leaves such a pair tied, both rows survive,
    and the state fold then reports the replaced one, so a lane whose newest run
    succeeded reads as a blocking failure. The run id orders them on its own.

    Two rows of ONE run do not replace each other and both survive, because they share
    one id: a workflow can publish a check run through the Checks API under its own
    job's display name, so both are live at the same time and dropping either would
    hide a live failure. No filter on conclusion either -- discarding a cancelled
    newest run would revive the verdict of the run it superseded.
