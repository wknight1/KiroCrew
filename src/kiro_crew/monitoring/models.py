#: opened, so a burst of edits costs one wake rather than one per change.
DEFAULT_MONITOR_COALESCE_SECS = 240.0
#: A delivered wake re-arms after this long while the same actionable

#: How many consecutive COUNTED ticks may carry a byte-identical verdict before
#: the watch is retired as stuck. Counted in ticks because the thing being
#: counted is repeated conclusions, and a tick is when a conclusion is reached.
#:
#: The value is bounded on both sides by numbers already in this module rather
#: than chosen freely. It must EXCEED the floor's tick equivalent at the default
#: cadence (``DEFAULT_MONITOR_STALL_MIN_SECS // DEFAULT_MONITOR_CADENCE_SECS``,
#: which is 6), or the count never binds at the default and the constant is
#: decoration. And it must fall INSIDE the ticks a default watch gets before its

#: Least wall-clock a stall streak must cover before it may retire a watch.
#:
#: The tick count above answers "how many times did it reach the same
#: conclusion", which is the right question in the wrong unit on its own: cadence
#: is user-set from 15s to 86400s. The streak's clock starts on its FIRST counted
#: tick, so twelve ticks is ELEVEN intervals -- 3300s at the 300s default, 165s at
#: the 15s minimum -- and 165s of an unchanged subject is a watch whose agent is
#: still working. The trip therefore needs BOTH.
#:
#: This value is bounded on both sides too. It must exceed
#: ``DEFAULT_MONITOR_COALESCE_SECS`` by a wide margin, or a burst being folded
#: could look like a stall (1800 is 7.5 windows). And it must stay well under
#: ``DEFAULT_MONITOR_REALERT_SECS``, because a re-alert wakes the subject and
#: zeroes the streak: a floor at or past that interval could never be reached,
#: which is the unreachable-mechanism failure in its other direction. So
#: 240 << 1800 << 21600, and at the default cadence twelve ticks already span

    The decision is a *field* rather than the return value of the decision

    the controller should do, and nothing about what it saw. The evidence is not
    unreachable -- ``monitoring.controller.format_monitor_wake`` rebuilds both
    the changed facts and the wake text downstream, from
    ``MonitorState.last_observation`` and ``MonitorState.wake_instructions`` --
    but it is reachable only by re-deriving it from persisted state the verdict
    never named.

    That indirection is what keeps a subject reduced to one comparable
    fingerprint: a consumer obliged to rebuild the evidence itself cannot be
    handed a list it never asked for, so a second entry has nowhere to go.
    Naming the evidence on the verdict is what removes the re-derivation.

    ``entries`` is plural from the start. A subject that reports several
    independent conditions -- a failing check, a stale review stamp, an
    un-dispositioned finding -- is the reason this type exists, even though a
    single-subject probe fills it with exactly one entry today.

    There is deliberately no operator-facing text field here. Delivery composes
    the wake envelope from durable state in
    ``monitoring.controller.format_monitor_wake``, so a text field on the verdict
    would be a second way to say the same thing with nothing reading it. The
    change that gives such a field a reader is the one that should add it, where
    a single test can show the text being produced AND consumed.

    #: would carry that ceiling into a 15s cadence and trip a quarter of the way
    #: into its floor. Any translation from ticks to seconds breaks on a cadence
    #: change in one direction or the other, so nothing is translated.
    #:
    #: Reading the clock in the trip does NOT reopen the hazard a ceiling guards

    #: sitting through a long pending stretch would let the clock satisfy the floor
