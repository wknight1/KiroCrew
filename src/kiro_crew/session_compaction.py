"""Context-compaction policy and execution for :mod:`kiro_crew.session`.

The coordinator deliberately depends on a small owner facade instead of
importing ``kiro_crew.session``.  Session allocation and teardown still own the
registry, its lock, and the exact-identity ``_recycling`` marker; compaction
borrows those seams without becoming a second session manager.

One observation rides this boundary and decides nothing: ``_compact_session``
starts the ``compaction.keep`` shadow measurement
(``decisions/points/compaction_keep.py``) as an unawaited background task before it
picks an arm, so a consented install learns which tool calls an oracle would have
kept while the compaction itself runs byte-identically.

Calls between formerly patchable ``SessionManager`` methods go back through
the owner.  Besides preserving the public/private monkeypatch surface during
the extraction, that keeps one authoritative place for lifecycle operations
such as guarded reset and queue retirement.

        (``check_context_usage`` -> ``_trigger_compaction``) and the awaited
        between-turn one (``compact_if_needed``) -- and it is reached BEFORE the

        So every backend is covered and the measurement observes the transcript as it
        stands when the compaction was decided, not after it ran.

        A MANUAL ``/compact`` is excluded by construction, not by a flag: the
        dashboard dispatches that command as an ordinary turn through
        ``provider.stream_command("/compact")`` and never calls this method, so there
        is no manual path for the point to sit on.

        FIRE AND FORGET, and that is the contract the point's own docstring states:
        the task is created and never awaited, so the compaction proceeds on its own
        coroutine and nothing here can delay it, fail it or change its outcome. The
        worst case is a missing observation.

        an optional subsystem that is off until the owner consents (and this module is
