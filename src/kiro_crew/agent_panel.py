"""Each crew's own webview: a dashboard the crew itself decides the contents of.

A crew that runs long — a conductor holding a fleet of workers, a research loop,
anything that works unattended — accumulates state that answers the only
questions an operator actually has: how many workers am I holding, which one is
stuck, what is my next step, is anything waiting on a decision. Its drawer today
shows activity counts, a path list, wake sources and config, none of which
answer those. This module is the store behind a webview in that drawer which
does.

One webview per crew, and the crew fills it
-------------------------------------------
The view is free-form HTML and it is configurable: each crew gets a TEMPLATE,
authored once, and at runtime the crew publishes only the DATA that fills it.
A crew whose name matches an installed template gets that template; a crew with
no template of its own falls back to a generic one that renders any data object.

The split that makes free-form HTML safe
----------------------------------------
Only the data comes from the crew.

The template is HTML a human wrote and reviewed — versioned in the repository,
or dropped on disk by the operator — free to lay out whatever it likes. The
crew never writes it: the template directory is write-protected from agent file
tools (see ``security._WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS``) AND sealed read-only for a
sandboxed shell (``sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES``), so the only way a crew
influences its webview is by publishing a data object through the MCP tool.
Write-protected rather than fenced outright, because the operator who authored
the override has to be able to read it back: the file holds no secret, and the
threat is authoring markup here, not seeing it. The records are the stricter
case and are fenced both ways (``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``,
``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES``).

The published DATA is fenced the same way, which is easy to get backwards: the
record is not "the crew's own file". It carries the ownership claim the store
reads back to refuse a colliding write, and it is the REDACTED copy of untrusted
text — so a crew that could write it directly would forge another crew's panel
past both the ownership check and the redactors in one step.

That matters because a conductor reads issue bodies, pull-request descriptions
and review comments on a loop with nobody at the keyboard, so a path exists from
a hostile issue body to whatever renders this. Keeping layout out of the crew's
hands means the untrusted half is *data*, and data can be escaped at a single
boundary -- :func:`compose` below -- rather than trusted to be well-formed
markup. The sandboxed frame the drawer renders into stays as defence in depth,
not as the only defence.

Where a panel lives
-------------------
In a gateway-only records directory, ``crew-panels/<slug>.json`` under the data
home -- NOT in the crew's own member space, which is where an earlier draft of
this module put it. A record is an ownership authority and the redacted copy of
untrusted text, so all three ways of writing it are closed on that one name: the
publishing MCP tool never touches the file (it POSTs to the gateway), the agent's
file tools are fenced by ``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``, and a sandboxed shell
is bind-masked by ``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES``. ``members/`` could give none of
those, because a crew owning its own published data is exactly what makes that
tree writable.

Published data is therefore FENCED, not readable state: only the gateway reads or
writes it, and the drawer reaches it through a cookie-authed route that checks the
record's stored owner. See :func:`_real_dir_under_data_home` for the invariant all
of that rests on -- one name, one inode, every disposition attached to it.

Deliberately generic
--------------------
Nothing here knows what a "worker" or a "pull request" is. The store holds an
opaque JSON object and the id of a template to render it with; the conductor is
the first consumer, not the schema.

    **the bytes the gateway reads must be reachable by exactly one name, and every
    disposition must attach to that name.** A fence, a mask and a precreate are all
    assertions about a PATH, so any gap between the path named and the path used
    voids them, whatever opens the gap:

    * ``members/<slug>/`` -- the name sat in a tree with no fence at all;
    * ``trust/`` -- the name sat in a tree with a standing sandbox write exception;
    * an ABSENT directory -- the disposition named a path that did not exist, so the

    * a SYMLINKED directory -- this. ``.resolve()`` follows links, so the store wrote

      attached to the link. The link name stays in the writable data home, so a
      sandboxed process can unlink it and put its own directory there.

    So the leaf is NOT resolved: it is required to be a real directory under this
    name, and a link is refused rather than followed. Ancestors are deliberately
    left alone -- ``config_dir()`` documents that a symlinked data HOME is
    supported, and refusing that would break a layout the product allows.

    refuses on the same shape. That tradeoff is right where it lives: a read-only

    lossy. Together they broke a real case: a crew whose name happens to look
    credential-shaped (an ``AKIA``-prefixed 20-character name is enough) had its
    stored owner replaced by ``[REDACTED: credential]``, which then matched no
    exact name at all -- so that crew could never read its own panel.

    Splitting the two jobs fixes it: ``crew`` stays the redacted DISPLAY text, and
    this digest is what ownership is decided on. Comparing digests is exactly as
    strict as comparing names, because the input is the exact name either way.

    Hashed rather than stored raw for the same reason the display text is
    redacted: if the name IS credential-shaped, the record must not persist it.
    Plain SHA-256 mirrors ``kiro_prerequisite._claim_digest``, which hashes a claim

    this exact question, rather than a keyed scheme of this module's own with a key

    Whole-document replacement rather than a merge: a panel describes the state
    of one cycle, and a partial update would leave last cycle's rows sitting

    OWNERSHIP IS THE EXACT CREW NAME, not the slug, and it takes TWO things to
    hold -- they are one story, not two half-guards:

    1. The record lives in the gateway-only records directory (see
       :func:`panel_dir`), which no agent file tool and no sandboxed command can
       write, so ``publish`` is the ONLY way a panel is written. In the crew's own
       unfenced member space a colliding crew could skip this function entirely
       and write the file, and any check here would be theatre.
    2. Inside the lock, a stored ``crew`` that differs from the caller's is
       refused. Slugification is lossy -- ``Oncall`` and ``oncall`` reach one slug
       -- so without this either would overwrite the other and the operator would
       read one crew's state under the other's name.

    The READ side enforces the same claim: ``api_member_panel`` requires the exact
    crew name and refuses to hand back a record another crew owns. Guarding only
    the write left the loser of a collision still reading the winner's dashboard.

    Following the member layer's existing answer to the same lossiness rather than
    inventing a second convention: ``members.slug_for_name`` documents that it is
    not unique, and ``record_activity`` matches on BOTH the session and the exact
    ``member`` name for exactly this reason.
