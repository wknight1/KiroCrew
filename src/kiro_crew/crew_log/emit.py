"""Write the ACP turn lifecycle to an append-only per-session crew log.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/crew-log-emitter.md`` for the contract this
module implements. In short: each entry point is a one-line call at a site in the
dashboard chat path where a lifecycle fact is already known, and every one of
them is **fail-soft** -- a crew log error is reported once and then swallowed, so a
broken crew log can never break a turn.

The whole module is inert unless ``KIROCREW_CREW_LOG`` is truthy. With the
flag off nothing is created and every call returns immediately.

The grouping identity of a session entry is ``data.turn`` -- the runner's own turn
ordinal -- and, inside a turn, ``data.step``, the MODEL CALL the entry belongs to.
A tool entry also carries ``data.call_index``, its position among that turn's tool
calls, which is what ``step`` meant before a model call had a name of its own: one
model call can issue several tools at once, so the step cannot order them. All are
known at EMIT time, so an entry answers "what happened in this turn" on its own,
with nothing to look up and no earlier line to resolve against.

The envelope's ``thread`` field is left unset here. ``thread`` points at another
LINE's ``seq``, which only a unit whose anchor line is written before the entries
citing it can supply; that is the crew's log shape, not this one's.

Three things are recorded differently from a naive reading of the lifecycle, all
deliberate and all explained in the spec:

* ``compaction/applied`` carries context-usage **percentages**, because the
  compaction boundary never learns a raw token count.
* A tool call and an approval are identified by an id inside ``data``, not by
  ``ref``. A ``Ref`` is a citation of another crew log's lines, and a tool call id
  names a frame on the ACP stream, which is not a crew log unit.
* A turn that ends without its terminal event is still CLOSED, by the turn's own
  ``finally``: ``stop_reason: "failed"``, an ``error`` naming the exception class
  when one was caught, and no ``tokens`` or ``credits``, because none were
  measured. Leaving the start open would say the writer died, which this process
  being alive contradicts -- and nothing here would correct it, since the
  interrupted-turn repair is opt-in and only a resume asks for it. A recovery
  re-entry anchors its own thread carrying ``depth``.

**Storage never runs on the caller's thread when that thread is the event
loop.** Every entry point is called from the dashboard's async chat path, and
the storage call underneath takes the unit's lock, reads a bounded tail to
assign ``seq`` and ``fsync``s the appended line -- a waiting ``flock`` and a
kernel ``fsync`` once per tool frame and once per turn, on the one loop that
also drives the liveness heartbeat. So an entry point does only what must be
measured where it is called and hands the storage call to
:func:`kiro_crew.executors.crew_log_executor`, whose single worker drains the work
in the order the call sites produced it.

**Which turn an entry belongs to is carried IN the entry, not looked up.** Every
session entry that belongs to a turn names it in ``data.turn`` -- the runner's own
turn ordinal, which the call site already holds -- plus ``data.step`` for the model
call it happened in, and a tool entry also carries ``data.call_index``. So nothing
has to be cached,
read back from a line written earlier, or kept alive across a queue: an entry is
self-describing the moment it is built, and a lost or evicted piece of in-process
state cannot make it name the WRONG turn.

The envelope's ``thread`` field stays unset on a session entry. ``thread`` points
at another LINE's seq, which is only knowable for a unit whose anchor line is
written before the entries that cite it; that is the crew's log shape, not
this one's.

Two rules govern the writer, and neither gives way to the other: a lifecycle
record is not dropped merely for crossing the BACKPRESSURE high-water mark, because
a hole in an append-only log is permanent and silent, and the event loop is never
BLOCKED, because a turn must not wait on a disk. So a producer appends to an
in-memory buffer and returns, and one worker drains it in batches. The buffer has
hard count and byte ceilings to prevent an OOM from losing every session's debt;
records refused at those ceilings are counted separately by
:func:`overflow_writes`. Fail-soft governs ERRORS, not backpressure.

A failed append is RETAINED, not swallowed. The batch goes back to the front of
its session's bucket, every later write for that session queues behind it, and the
writer retries with a short doubling backoff. Bounded, because entries live in
memory until they are written: past :data:`_MAX_WRITE_ATTEMPTS` consecutive failed
passes the batch is dropped and counted in :func:`dropped_writes`, so a wedged
disk becomes a reported loss instead of a wait no bounded caller can finish. A
REFUSAL -- a ``CrewLogError``, decided before any byte is written -- is not retried
at all: it would be refused identically every time, and retrying it would hold
that session's whole log behind one entry that can never land.

With no event loop running the write happens inline on the calling thread --
which is what makes a synchronous caller, and the test suite, deterministic.
:func:`flush` waits for the buffers to drain when a caller needs the file on disk
before it looks, and :func:`drain_for_shutdown` is the quiescence barrier a
restart needs: buffered entries are in memory, so an exit that skips it loses the
last thing each session did.

    The two rules this satisfies together, which the queue-with-a-cap could not:

    A lifecycle record is never dropped merely for crossing the BACKPRESSURE
    high-water mark. A hole in an append-only log is permanent and silent -- a
    reader cannot tell a turn that never completed from one whose completion was
    discarded -- so the writer falling behind sheds nothing on its own. The buffer
    does have hard COUNT and BYTE ceilings, far above that mark, that exist only so
    a filesystem which has stopped answering cannot grow it until an OOM takes
    every session's unwritten entries at once; an entry rejected at a ceiling is
    counted separately in :func:`overflow_writes`, and the file-creating record and
    loss markers are exempt from it. Otherwise an entry is given up on only when
    the filesystem refuses it or keeps refusing to take it, and then it is counted
    in :func:`dropped_writes` rather than lost quietly.

    The event loop is never BLOCKED. A producer appends to an in-memory buffer and
    returns; it never waits for the writer and never touches the filesystem. So a
    disk that has stopped keeping up costs memory, which is visible and reported,
    instead of turn latency, which stalls the gateway.

    The buffer is therefore bounded by memory rather than by a backlog-depth
    policy: crossing the high-water mark is reported rather than acted on, and only
    the hard memory ceilings above ever reject an entry -- shedding records for
    merely being numerous is the thing the first rule forbids.

    With no event loop running the write happens inline. That is not a fallback
    on the loop path -- there is no loop to protect, the caller is a thread that
    asked for this, and it keeps a synchronous caller and the test suite
    deterministic. It is ORDERED against the writer in both directions.
    ``flock`` stops two appends from interleaving but does not decide which lands
    first, so writing here while the writer holds a claimed batch could put this
    entry at a lower seq than one emitted before it -- and a log whose seq
    disagrees with causality is worse than a short one, because a fold cannot
    detect it. So the inline path is taken only for a session that owes nothing:
    no retained batch, no buffered entry, no other inline write. And an inline
    write that FAILS is retained like any other, never swallowed -- otherwise a
    synchronous caller's entry would be the one kind this writer silently loses.

    happened, and a missing entry is indistinguishable from a fact that never
    occurred. A crash-shaped loss is different in kind -- the repair machinery
    names and closes what a kill left behind -- but a discard chosen while the
    process is healthy has nothing that can recover it and no reader that can
    detect it. So a filesystem that stops answering costs MEMORY, reported through
    :func:`buffered_writes`, :func:`peak_buffered_writes` and the high-water
    warning, and a write in flight too long is named by :func:`_note_stall_if_any`.

    That memory has a ceiling. Past :data:`_MAX_PENDING_COUNT` appends or
    :data:`_MAX_PENDING_BYTES` of bodies -- both far above the high-water mark, so a
    gateway keeping up never reaches them -- holding more risks an OOM that takes
    every session's unwritten entries with it, uncounted, which is the larger

    older one shed from the head: the queued prefix keeps its order and stays a
    faithful run of the log, and the loss is that log's tail stopping at a counted
    point rather than its middle disagreeing with causality. The rejection is
    counted in :func:`overflow_writes` and named once per session, and the entry's
    own cleanup still runs so nothing waits on a record that will never land.

    Two jobs are EXEMPT from the ceiling (``_PendingJob.exempt_ceiling``) and can
    never be refused here: the record that CREATES a session's crew log file, and a
    loss marker. Both are O(1) per session, so neither is the memory the ceiling
    bounds -- and refusing the creating record destroys that session's whole log

    The quiescence barrier a restart needs: entries live in memory until the

    not been written yet -- exactly the records a crash-time log is wanted for.

    Blocking here is correct where blocking a producer is not: this runs on the
    shutdown path, which has nothing left to keep responsive. Bounded all the
    same, so a wedged filesystem delays exit by *timeout* rather than hanging it.
    Returns True when the buffers reached empty AND no batch is still in flight.

    Both conditions, because a claimed batch is not in ``_pending`` any more: the
    writer takes a batch out of the buffer before it writes it, so an empty buffer
    on its own says nothing about whether those entries reached the file. Reporting
    drained there is the worst available answer -- the caller exits believing the
    record is complete, and the entries in that batch are the last thing each
    session did.

    The inline fallback runs at most one pass, and only when NO writer batch is
    claimed. Two threads appending to one file is not merely a race for the lock:
    ``flock`` serializes the writes but does not order them, so the batch claimed
    second can reach the file first and a ``turn/started`` can land at a lower seq
    than the ``session/opened`` before it. A log whose seq disagrees with causality
    is worse than a short one, because a fold cannot detect it. The timed wait above
    already waits on ``not _draining``, so reaching the fallback with a batch still
    claimed means the writer is wedged holding it -- and then the only safe answer is
    to write nothing.

    Residual, in two shapes. A batch the wedged writer holds cannot be finished from
    this thread. And when that batch is still claimed, the entries buffered BEHIND it
    are left alone too, so they are lost at exit rather than written out of order. A
    False return means exactly that: the log's tail is short, and the warning says
    how short.

    A retained batch is retried rather than waited out. Its backoff is a schedule in
    seconds and this process is leaving, so honouring it here does not defer the
    write, it loses it. :func:`_drain_inline_until` therefore claims a batch inside
    its backoff -- but PACES the attempts across the remaining budget, because a
    batch has few attempts before it is dropped and spending them in microseconds
    turns a filesystem that needed a moment into a permanent hole. What bounds this
    path is still *timeout*; a batch still owed when it expires is reported by the
    warning, and one that ran out of attempts is counted in :func:`dropped_writes`.

    Called once per turn, because the per-turn session claim is where the ACP
    id becomes known -- but an entry is written only when there is something new
    to say: the crew log was just created, or this claim RE-ATTACHED to an existing
    conversation (a new gateway process taking over the same session id). A warm
    reuse of a session already carrying a crew log adds nothing, so it is silent.

    ``owner`` and ``agent`` are header fields, written once at create time and
    never rewritten. A resumed session id reuses its existing crew log and
    appends, so an agent or model switch that kept the conversation continues
    one log rather than starting a second one. ``model`` is not a header field
    in the storage schema, so it is carried on this entry instead.

    ``model`` is the id the backend CONFIRMED, and it is empty whenever that id
    is not known. It alone cannot say what the gateway chose: no tier resolved
    anything above the backend's own default, a chosen model was applied, or a
    chosen one never took effect and the backend's choice serves instead (a model
    this account cannot run is withheld before it is sent, and a ``set_model``
    that raises is logged and left alone). Each of the last two can end with an id
    here or without one.

    So ``model_requested`` records what the gateway SELECTED for the ALLOCATION
    that produced this session, and its presence is not conditioned on ``model``.
    The caller resolves that value once, hands it to the provider and retains it
    with the slot, because the turn that observes a session is not always the one
    that allocated it: an eager allocation can outlive a config change, and
    re-resolving at the first turn would record a model that session never used.
    Selection is not transmission either: the withhold happens inside the
    provider, so this field names the choice rather than a message the backend
    received. The pair is the record -- ``model`` states what serves the session,
    ``model_requested`` what was chosen -- and the entry infers nothing from the
    two. A difference between them is not by itself a refusal, because the backend
    serves the spelling it resolved; whether a choice was APPLIED is not something
    this entry knows, and a reader that needs it reads the provider's own outcome
    rather than comparing these strings. Absent ``model_requested`` means no tier
    resolved one, OR that this process did not observe the allocation (a re-attach
    carries provenance from a process that is gone) -- and on an entry written
    before the field existed it means nothing at all.

    ``parent_slot`` names the session that made this one through
    ``session_create`` (the slot's ``_created_by``), and ``parent_sid`` the
    creator's ACP session id as ``session_create`` froze it at mint (the slot's
    ``_created_by_sid``) -- the creator crew log that holds the call. The edge is
    written on the CHILD because that is the side that knows it: the creator is
    stamped on the slot at mint, before any turn, while the creator never learns
    the child's session id, which is assigned at the child's first turn. The sid
    is NOT read live here: a creator slot can be closed and replaced between the
    mint and the child's first turn, and a live read would cite the replacement's
    crew log in an entry that can never be corrected. Both empty means nobody
    created this session (a person's own tab, a fork) and no ``parent`` is
    written at all, so a fold can tell "no creator" from "creator unknown".

    ``memory``, ``app`` and ``channel`` record WHAT KIND of session this log
    belongs to: the slot's memory mode verbatim, the app that owns it if one does,
    and whether its conversation is published to a messaging channel by a link or
    a mirror. They are written as one ``class`` object and only when ``memory`` is
    given, which makes that member the witness that the class was recorded -- so a
    reader can tell a session with nothing to declare from a log written before
    this existed, and must refuse rather than assume on the second.

    They belong on the record rather than in a live lookup because the question
    they answer -- may another session read this log -- is asked about sessions
    that have CLOSED, and a closed session has no slot left to ask. They are also
    facts and not a verdict: recording "readable" would freeze this build's reading
    of a rule into an entry that can never be corrected. The facts are true when
    the log is opened; a class a session ACQUIRES later (a channel link added
    mid-conversation) is not in them, so a reader that can also see the live
    session applies both and refuses on either.

    A child is reported present while this process owes ANY entry for
    *session_id*, on top of what the registry says. A terminal outcome reaches
    the file through the writer and :func:`_submit` returns before it lands, so a
    child leaves the running set while its own closer is still queued: the file
    then shows an opener with no match while the registry omits the child. Closing on that reading puts a synthesised ``unknown`` ahead of the
    real outcome and leaves both standing in a file nothing rewrites. The debt
    set is the exact record of what is still owed -- queued, claimed by the
    writer, retained, and owed loss markers alike -- and it is the one source
    here carrying no bound that
    could shed a pending child, which the manager's completed-run retention does
    carry. An entry a hard ceiling refuses is absent from the debt set, which is
    the wanted answer: that closer is never coming, so the opener is the
    repair's to close.

    The two reads live in different lock domains, so they are sampled at
    different instants and their ORDER decides whether the gap between them can
    lie. Liveness is read first for that reason.

    Neither read is enough on its own, because the normal completion path flips
    ``done`` long BEFORE the closer is recorded: the manager's running set is
    everything not done, so the child leaves it at the flip, and the terminal
    entry is handed over later from the report task. Between those two the child
    is absent from the running set and owes nothing, and a repair reading exactly
    there synthesises an ``unknown`` that then stands beside the real outcome. So
    the child's OWN origin pin is consulted too: it is opened when the spawn is
    recorded and released only once the closer has been handed to the writer, an
    interval that contains that whole gap, and it is per-child rather than
    per-session. What remains is the pin the FIFO drops under its own ceiling,

    A TODO update is a WHOLE list, not a delta: the agent re-sends every task on
    every change, so the entry is the list as of this update and a reader diffs
    consecutive entries itself. ``items`` is the stream's own ``tasks`` array of
    ``{id, text, completed}``. ``None`` means the event said nothing about the
    plan and no entry is written; an empty LIST means the agent cleared its plan,
    which is a change and is recorded as one.

    ``state`` is two-valued -- ``done`` / ``open`` -- because that is all the
    stream carries. The backend's todo model is a plain ``completed`` boolean with
    no in-progress state, as the slot's own snapshot code documents, so a
    three-state vocabulary would be invented here and is not written.

    The list is bounded twice, by COUNT and by BYTES, and both bounds keep the real
    count in ``total`` so a clipped record still says how much it is not showing.
    Count alone is not enough: ``_clip`` bounds each ``text`` in characters while the

    and twelve on a surrogate pair -- so a hundred separately-legal rows of emoji
