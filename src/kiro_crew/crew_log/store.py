"""The append-only crew log store: one file per unit, the gateway the only writer.

Layout, resolved against the live data home on every call (never captured at
import, so pod isolation and test isolation both keep working)::

    <data home>/crew-log/crews/<store name>/log.jsonl
    <data home>/crew-log/sessions/<store name>/log.jsonl

``<store name>`` is the readable-plus-digest fold of the unit id that
``session_ledger`` and ``work_ledger`` already use, and the raw id lives in the
header (see :func:`crew_log_dir` for why the id is not the directory name). Both
files carry a ``.lock`` sibling in the same directory.

One dedicated ``crew-log`` root, holding every kind, is what carries the
protection: the leaf is hidden from a sandboxed process by the OS and fenced from
the agent's own file tools, and both fences are stated per leaf, so every kind
under this root inherits them and a new kind cannot be left out by omission. A
record a conductor is meant to trust as authority must not be forgeable by
anything that can call ``open()``, and a tool gate does not answer a subprocess --
which is why the session half does NOT live under the ``sessions`` transcript
root it would otherwise have shared.

Three properties are the whole design.

**Append only.** A line, once written, is never rewritten. There is exactly ONE
mutation: on ``open``, trailing bytes that are not a complete line are dropped.
Everything else -- a damaged interior line, an unknown envelope key, a type from
a newer writer -- is handled on the READ side by skipping or ignoring, never by
repairing the file. So two readers of the same bytes always agree, and a reader
is never the thing that changes history.

**Torn is decided by termination, not by taste.** Every append writes
``line + "\\n"`` and fsyncs, so a file that does not end in a newline was
interrupted mid-write. Those trailing bytes are the crash artifact and are
truncated -- unless they happen to parse whole, in which case only the newline
was lost: the record is kept and the next append re-supplies the separator. A
line that IS newline-terminated but does not parse is damage *inside* history,
so it is skipped on read and left on disk. Nothing else can be torn, which is
why this rule needs no heuristics.

**Seq comes from the file, under the lock.** ``seq`` is read back from the tail
inside the critical section on every append rather than trusted from the
in-process cache, so two writers cannot both believe they own the same number.
The read is a bounded window at the end of the file (``_TAIL_WINDOW``), not a
scan, so it costs the same on a crew log with ten lines and one with a million.
``.last_seq`` serves the cached value for callers that only want to look.

    The ONE spelling of deletion in this package, called by the retention sweep
    and by the permanent-delete funnel alike, for the reason the work crew log's
    ``purge_matching`` docstring gives: two callers deleting the same tree two
    ways is two chances to get the order wrong, and the order is the whole
    correctness argument.

    **Ownership first.** Removal goes THROUGH the lease, taken non-blocking and
    ``sole`` so it is shared with nothing: ownership is what stands between this
    and unlinking the segments a live writer is appending to. ``sole`` is not a
    detail -- the lease is refcounted per process, so a plain claim against a
    unit this process is already writing would SUCCEED by joining that count and
    prove nothing (see :func:`lease.acquire`). Either kind of contention answers
    ``owned``: this pass does nothing, and nothing is written either, so a unit
    whose writer outlives the sweep is simply collected by a later one.

    **Then the caller re-decides, INSIDE the hold.** *guard* is REQUIRED and is
    called as ``guard(directory)`` once ownership is held; the unit is removed
    only if it answers true. The lease alone is not enough, and the gap is the
    same one ``purge_matching`` documents: a selection made outside it is a
    SNAPSHOT, and ownership deliberately ends BETWEEN turns, so a session can be
    revived, append, finish its turn and release the lease in the window between
    the decision and the delete -- after which the removal would take a live
    conversation's log while contending with nobody. Re-reading under the hold is
    what makes the decision current, which is why the guard is a callback rather
    than a filter the caller applies first, and why there is no default that
    skips the re-decision. A caller whose precondition is not a property of the
    file passes ``lambda _dir: True`` and says at the call site what does decide.

    **Then order, with IDENTITY LAST.** Segments carry the header, so they are the
    history and they go first; the per-append lock file next; then any other
    entry, none of them followed if it is a link. The ``.lease`` file is removed
    LAST and only by its holder, which is what keeps ``lease``'s inode check a
    fact about this code: while it exists, the lease path names the file whose
    lock proves ownership, and a lease unlinked before the segments would let a
    second remover take a lock on a fresh inode and unlink the same files
    concurrently. Windows refuses an in-hold unlink and gets it after release
    instead, which is safe there precisely because it fails while any handle is
    open -- the same asymmetry :func:`session_ledger.unlink_lock_in_hold`
    documents, so that function is reused rather than copied.

    **Nothing is written to a crew log that is about to go.** No "pruned" entry, no
    tombstone: removal is not rotation and not a format change, and a reader
    holding a citation into the unit already has its answer from
    ``Ref.resolve``, which reports ``gone`` for a pointer into a unit that has no
    crew log at all.

    Failures are COUNTED, not ignored, and reported for what they are. A unit
    that could not be fully removed answers ``failed`` rather than being reported
    as collected, and stays addressable so the next pass can aim at it again --
    but ``failed`` does not promise its history survived. Segments go first, so
    the ordinary partial removal is history already gone with something else left
    standing; the log line says which of the two happened rather than claiming
    the segments were kept.

      read from the OLDEST surviving segment, which is where ``CrewLog.open``
      resolves it, and it is accepted only if it folds BACK to this directory's
      own name. A directory no id addresses is not removed, because the removal
      would be aimed by id and would resolve somewhere else.
    * **A torn tail.** Unterminated trailing bytes are what
      ``open(repair=True)`` truncates, and the sweep cannot tell a dead writer's
      crash artifact from an append that has not yet reached its fsync -- the
      bytes are identical. Deleting the unit would destroy the history the repair
      exists to recover, so the repair gets it and retention does not.
    * **The newest lifecycle entry is not a ``session/closed``.** An OPEN session
      is never touched, whatever its age, and this is the check that decides it.
      The pair ``session/opened`` / ``session/closed`` is what moves a unit
      between the two states, so the newest of the PAIR is the answer -- not the
      newest close on its own. A resumed session appends to the crew log it already
      had, so ``... closed ... opened ...`` is a legitimate file whose session is
      running right now. The read is bounded, so the deciding entry could in
      principle sit further back than the window -- but only entries written after
      it can push it out, and once a unit is closed the emitter writes nothing but
      a handful of in-flight closers unless the session was revived, which appends
      its own ``session/opened``. So a lifecycle entry outside the window means a
      live session, which is exactly the unit that must be kept: the bound fails
      closed rather than needing a full scan of every crew log on every pass.
    * **A segment that vanished mid-read.** Another remover -- the delete funnel,
      or a second pass -- got there first, which is the outcome this sweep wanted.
      It reads as "nothing to do" rather than as a failure, because the caller's
      failure tally is what an operator reads as "these units still hold
      history", and counting a race that already collected one would make that
      number a lie.

    The age comes from the LAST ``session/closed`` entry's own ``time``, falling
    back to the newest segment's mtime only when that field is unusable. The
    entry wins because it is the writer's own record of when the session ended
    and nothing rewrites it, while mtime is metadata a copy, a restore or a
    backup tool resets -- a restored tree would read as freshly closed and never
    expire. The fallback is kept rather than skipping the unit because a damaged
    ``time`` still proves the session ended, and mtime is then the best available
    bound on when writing stopped; it can only be at or after the real close, so
    it errs toward keeping the file.

        ``child_gone`` narrows what ``repair`` is allowed to conclude, and is the
        only thing that lets it close an unmatched ``subagent/spawned``. A child
        outlives its asking turn by design, so an unmatched opener does NOT mean
        the child is finished -- a writer torn down inside a live process can leave
        one still running and still able to file its own real terminal, which would
        put two outcomes for one ``agent_id`` in a file nothing rewrites. No fact
        derivable from the file answers this, and no flag does either: what settles
        it is the live subagent registry of the process doing the repair, so the
        caller that holds one passes a predicate over ``agent_id``. Omitted, no
        child is closed -- the direction that leaves a reader behind rather than
        wrong.

        A zero-byte file answers ``no_ledger``, the same answer ``create`` gives
        it. One meaning for an empty file across both paths is what keeps them
        from disagreeing: a create that could not finish leaves nothing behind,
        and a retry succeeds instead of being refused by the fragment.

        ``repair`` is what closes an INTERRUPTED TURN, and it is opt-in because
        the two callers of ``open`` want opposite things. A RESUME -- the gateway
        finding a session log whose writer is gone -- wants the open turn
        closed, and passes ``repair=True``. A live writer RECONNECTING to its own
        crew log must not: its turn is still running, and closing it would append a
        ``turn/completed {interrupted}`` in the middle of a turn that then keeps
        writing, so the record would claim an outcome the turn never had. A
        reconnect happens for reasons that have nothing to do with the writer's
        health -- a handle evicted from a bounded cache is enough -- so repair
        cannot be inferred from the fact that an ``open`` is happening at all. See
        :func:`_close_interrupted_tail`; the torn-tail truncation below is

        never exists. Written together, a crash leaves either the whole group or a
        torn tail, and the tail is what the next append truncates.

        *cite* is how a citation is made unable to disagree with the allocation. The
        caller passes ONLY the cited entries in *items* and a callable; this method
        calls it INSIDE the lock, with the seqs it has just allocated for those
        entries, and appends what it returns as the group's last member. Allocating
        outside the lock and citing the result cannot be made correct: the lock is a
        cross-process one, so between a caller's read of the tail and this method's
        read another handle -- a resumed session, a second process -- can append and
        shift the whole run, after which the citation names seqs belonging to the
        intruder. Nothing detects that later: the seqs exist and parse.

        Every refusal still happens before any byte is written -- each item is
        validated up front, and a *cite* result is validated before the write it
        joins -- so a rejected group leaves the file identical. One lock, one
        ``write()``, one ``fsync``.

        ``thread`` is deliberately not accepted here. A group is self-contained by
        construction, and an anchor check per member would have to re-read the tail
        it is being allocated from.

        Four outcomes. ``ok`` carries the entries. ``gone`` means the cited crew log
        does not exist at all -- a normal answer, not an error, since the cited
        crew log may legitimately have been deleted and the citing entry stays honest
        about having pointed at it. ``pruned`` means the span reaches below the
        oldest surviving segment's first seq, so retention removed those lines.
        ``corrupt`` means the span lies inside a segment that still exists yet read
        short, which is damage.

        The last two are never reported as each other, and the classification is
        made from the segment names rather than from the short read: a reader told
        ``pruned`` stops looking, because retention removing old lines is a normal
        answer, while ``corrupt`` tells it the file it still has is not intact.
        Reporting damage as retention would turn a recoverable alarm into silence.
        Citing PAST the newest entry is ``corrupt`` as well, and deliberately not
        ``ok``: a ``Ref`` always names a definite span -- an absent ``to_seq``
        means the single line at ``from_seq``, so there is no open-ended spelling
        -- which makes a span reaching beyond the newest entry a claim about lines
        that are not in the file. ``ok`` means every cited seq was read back.

        This layer makes NO authorization claim, and takes no access callback. A
        half-built one would be worse than none: a check that defaults to allow
        makes the shortest call shape the insecure one, and a check with no
        permission model behind it only looks like a boundary. Every caller today
        is in-process gateway code that can already read the file. A ``forbidden``
        status arrives with the first caller that HAS a permission model -- the

    Three kinds of opener can be left unbalanced, and they are NOT scoped alike.

    A ``turn/started`` with no later ``turn/completed`` means the writer stopped
    mid-turn. Unmatched ``tool/called`` and ``approval/requested`` entries are
    collected only from INSIDE that turn: both are turn-scoped by construction --
    a call completes within its turn, and an approval is decided in the same
    ``finally`` that the turn's own path runs through -- so an unmatched one in a
    turn that DID complete is a different anomaly, and inventing an outcome for it
    here would be this reader editing history it was not asked about.

    An unmatched ``subagent/spawned`` is collected across the WHOLE file instead,
    because a child is deliberately not turn-scoped: it starts, steers and reports
    long after its asking turn ended, so the ordinary dangling case is a child
    whose turn completed normally. Scoping it to the open turn would close only the
    rare child that died inside its own turn and leave every common one open
    forever.

    Children are kept only when *child_gone* says so, and that asymmetry is the
    point. "The writer is gone" is what a repair knows, and for a turn-scoped
    opener that settles it -- the turn died with its writer. It does NOT settle a
    child: a child outlives the turn that asked for it BY DESIGN, so a writer
    torn down inside a live process can leave a child still running, still able to
    file its own real terminal. Closing it from here would put two outcomes for one
    ``agent_id`` in a file nothing rewrites. Nothing in the file distinguishes the
    two, so the question goes to the caller's live subagent registry; with no
    predicate the answer is "still running" and the opener stands.

    This fold feeds a mutation, so it reports every record the ordinary reader
    would skip. A repair cannot distinguish a truly open turn from one whose real
    completion is damaged, and appending a closer after such a skip would make a

    still open, so closing them the other way round would produce a record no live

    The turn closer is written only when a turn was actually open. A child that
    outlived a completed turn leaves this function with children and no turn, and
    appending a ``turn/completed`` there would close a turn that already closed
    itself.

    happened to open the file, so stamping it with the current clock would put a
    gap of arbitrary length inside a turn and make a duration computed off these

    """Append closers for an interrupted tail. Returns how many were written.

    Session logs only, and RESUME ONLY. A crash, a SIGKILL or a pod eviction
    leaves openers unbalanced, and every later reader then has to carry the same
    special case: is this still running, or did its writer die? Closing the tail
    when the crew log is LOADED after an interruption answers that once, in the
    record, instead of in each reader.

    Two openers are closed on any repair, each with the "not knowable from the
    record" word its own type already uses: an unmatched ``tool/called`` and an
    unmatched ``approval/requested``, both turn-scoped, both settled by the one
    thing a repair knows -- that the writer is gone.

    A third, ``subagent/spawned``, is closed only for an ``agent_id`` the caller's
    *child_gone* predicate reports finished. A child is not turn-scoped, so a
    writer torn down inside a LIVE process can leave a child still running and
    still able to file its own real terminal; closing it from here would put two
    outcomes for one ``agent_id`` in a file nothing rewrites. Only the repairing
    process's own registry of running children can rule that out. This can
    therefore fire on a file whose newest turn completed normally and whose only
    open thing is a child that outlived it.

    "Loaded after an interruption" is the whole precondition, which is why this is
    never reached from a plain ``open``. An open turn is indistinguishable from a
    dead one by looking at the file, so the CALLER's situation is the only thing
    that can tell them apart: a resume knows the previous writer is gone, and a
    live writer reconnecting to its own log knows it is not. Closing a turn
    that is still running would append an outcome it never had and then let the
    turn keep writing past its own completion.

    It stays append-only -- nothing is rewritten, seq continues -- so a reader that
    already folded the file sees only new lines.

    Best-effort by design: a closer that cannot be written leaves the tail open,
    which is the state every reader must already tolerate.
