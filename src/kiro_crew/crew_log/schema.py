"""Wire format for the append-only crew log: the header, the entry, the rules.

One crew log is one file. Line 1 is a **header** describing the unit the file
belongs to; every later line is an **entry**. Nothing is ever rewritten, so the
format has to be readable by a consumer newer *or* older than the writer:

- Unknown envelope keys are ignored rather than rejected, and an unparseable
  interior line is skipped rather than failing the read (see
  :mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.store`). ``version`` is the escape hatch for a future
  incompatible break, not a per-change workflow.
- An unknown TYPE is a different question from an unknown key, and the writer
  answers it per entry. ``ignorable: true`` says a reader may skip this line
  when it does not know the type; absent, an unknown type stops reconstruction,
  because a required entry a reader cannot interpret may change the meaning of
  everything after it. Skipping keys loses a detail, skipping a line can lose
  the plot.
- The envelope carries everything a fold needs on one axis, because this file is
  the only structured record of the unit's history: ``type`` spelled
  ``domain/action``, ``time`` in epoch milliseconds, a writer-assigned ``seq``
  contiguous within the file, a ``thread`` grouping key, and a ``ref`` pointer
  into another file. A fact with no unit to belong to -- a script cron, gateway
  lifecycle -- is written to a ``gateway``-kind crew log when one is needed.

Two rules decide whether an entry may be written at all, and they are separate
because they answer different questions.

**Ownership** (rule 1) answers *does this kind of unit have such events at
all*: a session has turns and tool calls, a crew has members and patrols. It is
a prefix registry, :data:`TYPE_OWNERSHIP`, so adding an action to an existing
domain needs no change here.

**Namespacing** (rule 2) answers *may this emitter write this*, and it is a rule
about ``src`` rather than about the spelling of the type. Each kind accepts its
own emitters (:data:`KIND_FIXED_SOURCES`, :data:`KIND_SOURCE_PREFIXES`): a
session's log takes ``gateway`` and ``acp``, a crew's log takes ``gateway``,
``dashboard``, ``patrol`` and the two guest forms ``crew:<name>`` and
``app:<name>``. A ``crew:<name>`` guest writes the crew kind's own built-in
domains, and its name in ``src`` is the signature -- a type carries the fact,
never the identity of who wrote it, so one ``crew/report`` type serves every
child. An ``app:<name>`` guest writes only under its own ``app:<name>/`` type
prefix, the single guest TYPE namespace this format keeps, for a fact no
built-in domain covers. That prefix is what makes the registry safe to keep
short: an app needs no registry entry, because its own name is its permission,
so an app type is checked by rule 2 *instead of* rule 1.

Caps refuse; they never truncate. An entry over :data:`MAX_ENTRY_BYTES`, or a
``ref`` spanning more than :data:`MAX_REF_SPAN` lines, is refused whole. A
silently clipped record the caller believes landed intact is a loss the caller
cannot detect.
