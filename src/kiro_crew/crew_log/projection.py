"""Folds over ONE session's crew log -- the side panel's five views, and the ledger.

The panel reads five, and those five are what the growth push carries. ``class`` is a
sixth registered fold that is deliberately NOT advertised: its reader is
a session deciding whether it may read ANOTHER unit's log, which is why it is held at
the most restrictive value the log ever recorded rather than at the current one.

A projection folds one crew log and carries that log's ``seq`` as its version
(RFC FR-5), so a reader that holds a projection at seq N and reads the entries
after N reaches the same value a reader folding the whole file from scratch
does. That equality is the module's contract and the property its tests pin.

The INCREMENTAL form is the primitive here and the whole-file form wraps it. A
fold is three pure pieces -- a starting state, one step per entry, and a render
-- and :func:`fold` is those pieces run over every entry. A separate batch
implementation would be a second codepath that can disagree with the resumed
one about the same bytes, and nothing in the file would say which is right.

State is JSON-serializable and is the CHECKPOINT: a caller may store it, hand it
back later with the seq it was taken at, and continue. It is deliberately not
the rendered value. A fold keeps bookkeeping a reader has no use for (the open
tool calls it is matching by ``call_id``, the attempt an open turn is on), and
:func:`Checkpoint.state` holding exactly what the fold needs to continue is what
lets the render stay the surface the dashboard reads.
:mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.checkpoint` writes that state beside the log, so a read
resumes where the last one stopped; this module owns no path and every failure
over there is answered by folding from seq 1 again.

Absent is never read as zero. ``turn/completed`` carries ``credits`` and
``tokens`` only on a provider-reported close, so a synthesized closer omits them
-- and a total that counted those turns as costing nothing would state a
measurement nobody made. Each total therefore rides beside the count of turns
that contributed to it, and a caller comparing the two learns what the total
covers.

Nothing here synthesizes history. An interrupted turn and an unmatched tool call
are reported as OPEN, never closed with an invented outcome: closing them is the
store's ``repair=True``, which appends real deterministic closers under write
ownership, and a reader inventing the same fact in memory would make two readers
of one file disagree.

This module reads its own unit's file and nothing else (FR-4: no fold reads more
than its own crew log) -- with ONE stated exception, and it is stated because a
reader has to know which kind of fold it is holding. The ``ledger`` fold is keyed
by SLOT, and a slot owns one ACP session id at a time rather than for its whole
life, so the record it answers for is spread over a unit per id the slot ran
under. It therefore joins those units (:func:`fold_slot`), which is a wider read
than the five panel folds make and is why it is not one of them: the growth push
and the side panel address a session, and a slot-wide value pushed under one
session's id would report a partial answer as the whole one. The units it joins
are still exactly one slot's own, so nothing here reads across slots.

Resolving a ``ref`` is the PAGE path's work, in the routes that serve a person a
citation to follow.

TEXT_LIMIT: Final[int] = 200

ID_LIMIT: Final[int] = 200

#: Entries folded per pass over a log. Five folds consume the same entries, so a

    *since* is a bundle from an earlier call and turns this into an incremental
    read: only the entries after its seq are consumed. It is discarded and the
    fold starts over in the two cases where continuing would be wrong -- the log
    is now SHORTER than the bundle (the unit was removed and recreated, so its
    seqs start again and the bundle describes different bytes), or the bundle is
    missing a name this call asks for.

    *log* is an already-open handle, so a caller that has just read
    ``last_seq`` folds against the same handle rather than opening the file
    twice.

    The on-disk savepoint (:mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.checkpoint`) is not optional
    and has no switch: with no reusable *since* the fold resumes from what is
    beside the log instead of from seq 1, and the result is written back once it
    has moved far enough to earn a write. A read that DID reuse *since* serves from
    it but writes nothing, because it cannot vouch for the prefix that bundle was
    folded from -- so a hot incremental reader's savepoint is brought forward by the
    next read that folds the prefix itself rather than by every read. A flag would be
    a public surface with no production caller, and it is not needed to reach the
    from-scratch answer -- :func:`fold` and :func:`advance` ARE that answer, and a
    savepoint is never load-bearing, since every failure over there falls back to
    folding from seq 1.
