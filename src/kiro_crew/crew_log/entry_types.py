"""Per-type ``data`` shapes for the session crew log entry types, checked on append.

:data:`TYPE_OWNERSHIP` answers whether a KIND of unit has such events at all, by
domain prefix. This module answers the next question -- what does one entry of
this type carry -- and it is the single machine-readable source for it. The shape
of a ``data`` payload is otherwise stated twice, in the emitter that builds it and
in a spec table describing it, and two statements of one fact drift.

**What a declaration is derived from.** The WRITER, not the table: every field
below is read off the site that produces it (:mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.emit`
for the ordinary entries, ``store._closer_entries`` for the crash-repair closers).
A type earns a declaration by having a writer, so the 20 declared here are exactly
the session types something writes today; a type nothing writes is left undeclared
and passes through, which is the posture ``message/steered`` already gets. A field
is ``required`` only when EVERY writer of that type produces it, which is why a few
fields the spec table marks required are optional here -- the repair closer knows
the turn and the reason and nothing else, and a required field it cannot supply
would refuse the one write that closes an interrupted turn.

**Undeclared keys are refused**, the same posture and for the same reason as
:func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.schema.build_header`: a caller that misspells a field
would otherwise be told the entry landed as asked while the value it meant to
record silently vanished. So a new field arrives with its declaration, in one
commit, or not at all.

**Values come in two strengths, and only one of them refuses.** ``enum_closed``
marks a vocabulary the WRITER itself clamps -- ``turn/started.actor`` and
``turn/refused.actor`` are coerced to
:data:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.emit.ACTORS` at the emitter -- so no caller can
produce a value outside it and enforcing costs nothing. Every other vocabulary is
PASSED THROUGH from
somewhere this module does not own: a provider's ``stop_reason``, the gateway's
own ``end_reason``, a provider's tool ``status``, a subagent runtime's outcome.
Those are recorded as ``enum`` for the reference tables and are NOT enforced,
because enforcing them converts "the upstream vocabulary grew" into "the entry is
refused and counted as a write loss" -- the registry would then destroy records
instead of catching mistakes.

Types with no declaration pass through untouched. That is what keeps the crew
crew log, whose own type families have no emitter, and every guest namespace
(``crew:<name>/…``, ``app:<name>/…``) writable while this covers the session
families that are written today.
