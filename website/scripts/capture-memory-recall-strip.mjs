/**
 * Screenshot harness for the transcript's recalled-memory strip, in its three shapes.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind the shared transcript harness, with
 * every /api/** call answered from fixtures. No gateway, no agent, no Jev: only the
 * network is stubbed, so `readMemoryRecallRecord`, the transcript virtualizer and the
 * strip itself render exactly as in production.
 *
 * Three fixtures, because the strip has three states a reader acts on differently:
 * a turn where Jev DROPPED some of the shortlist (the common case, and the one the
 * counts exist for), one where it kept everything (so "similarity 6 · Jev kept 6"
 * can be compared against the narrowed line rather than described), and one where
 * the decision FAILED (the error surface and its agent hand-off). The record rides
 * `meta.decisions_strip`, which is where a transcript reloaded from history carries
 * it.
 *
 * `/api/decisions/consent` is answered ON even though the strip does not read it, for
 * the reason the sibling `capture-decision-strip.mjs` gives: the Settings card shares
 * that query key, and answering it keeps the boot fixture honest about the state being
 * photographed. The strip draws from the record alone.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-memory-recall-strip.mjs [outDir]
