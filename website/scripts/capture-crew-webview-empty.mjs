/** Real-browser evidence for the crew webview EMPTY state.
 *
 * Drives the ISOLATED capture entry (website/capture/crew-webview-empty.html),
 * which mounts the REAL `CrewWebview` over a fetch boundary that answers the
 * member-panel read with `{ html: null }` -- the component's own `!html` empty
 * branch. The shot therefore shows the shipped `webview_empty` string, both
 * sentences, in the real drawer-width frame.
 *
 * The assertion the shot cannot fake: the SECOND sentence -- the setup
 * instruction "Add its panel server under Tools & MCP..." -- is present in the
 * rendered text, which is the sentence a prior screenshot missed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx vite --host 127.0.0.1 --port 6824 --strictPort    # in another shell (website/)
 *   node scripts/capture-crew-webview-empty.mjs http://127.0.0.1:6824 ../temp-screenshots/crew-webview
