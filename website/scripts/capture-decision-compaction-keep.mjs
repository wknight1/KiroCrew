/**
 * Screenshot harness for the two surfaces `compaction.keep` adds.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) with every /api/** call answered from
 * fixtures. No gateway, no agent and no Jev call: only the network is stubbed, so
 * `readCompactionKeepRecord`, `CompactionCard`'s three shapes, the transcript
 * virtualizer and the settings card render exactly as in production.
 *
 * Two surfaces, because the feature is a measurement and the consent that allows it:
 *
 *  - the LINE. One line under the compaction notice, saying what an oracle WOULD
 *    have kept. Five frames, because the record outlives whichever arm the
 *    compaction took: the success notice, the recycle notice, the ⚠-led failure
 *    that renders through the shared error surface, and the `completed` summary card
 *    both COLLAPSED and EXPANDED — that last one is the only shape with a
 *    disclosure, and the line sits outside the fold, so both states are claims.
 *    A line placed inside one branch would be absent from the others, and only a
 *    picture of each shows it is not. The summary frame's record also carries a
 *    `calls_truncated` count, which is the one piece of copy that appears
 *    conditionally.
 *  - the SWITCH. The third consent row on the Decisions (Jev) card, plus the
 *    point row it unlocks. The `withheld` pass serves the SAME fixtures with the
 *    scope revoked and ASSERTS both are absent, because "the row appears" is only
 *    half the claim.
 *
 * WHAT THIS HARNESS ASSERTS, and why it asserts anything at all: a capture script
 * that only writes PNGs fails toward a false pass -- a fixture typo, a clipped
 * card or a state that never arrived all still produce a tidy image a PR can cite.
 * So every frame also checks the words that make it that state, and the two
 * absence claims are checked rather than described.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-decision-compaction-keep.mjs [outDir]
