/**
 * InstanceTabBar — a thin, full-width strip at the very top of the dashboard
 * that switches between the local dashboard and connected remote crews.
 *
 * The switcher is a single dropdown by default: the number of crews a user
 * configures is unbounded, and a horizontal strip forced them to shrink the
 * window or scroll sideways to reach the last one, so the collapsed trigger
 * costs constant width no matter how many crews exist. A many-crew user can
 * PIN it open (see the Switcher pin) to trade that constant width for an
 * always-visible chip row, so switching costs no dropdown click.
 *
 * Unread counts survive that collapse in two places, because a count hidden
 * behind a closed menu would be invisible: the trigger carries an AGGREGATE
 * badge for every crew that is not on screen, and each menu row carries its
 * own. The bar appears ONLY when at least one remote crew is connected or
 * remembered, so the common single-crew experience is unchanged. Everything
 * *below* the bar is the switchable "window" — the Local dashboard, or a remote
 * crew's embedded dashboard (see InstancesViewport). The bar intentionally
 * carries no product brand of its own; each pane shows its own brand, so
 * switching never doubles the icon/title.
 *
 * A right-aligned cluster reflects the ACTIVE remote pane's tunnel connection
 * state + token auto-refresh countdown (host SSH expiry lives in the title bar,
 * not duplicated here).

   *
   * The floor's non-name half is read off this chip's own classes: `px-2` (16) +

   * `min-w-[16px]` (16) = 54px. Keep them in sync with the classes below;
   * `capture-crew-chip-shrink.mjs` asserts the declared floor against the measured

 * shortage out of every chip's name (each carries `truncate`) instead of holding
 * them at full width and letting whichever chip lands on the boundary be sliced
 * through its unread badge. Nothing outside this group moves: the topbar's grid
 * hands the identity group a width derived from the WINDOW (both side tracks are
 * `minmax(0,1fr)` and the group's `container-type:inline-size` keeps its content
 * out of that calculation), so widening the group would have to be paid for by
 * the centred search — which stays put.
 *
 * Wrapping into a hidden second row is the other way to keep chips whole, and it
 * is rejected: the row would hold its full ALLOCATED width with the wrapped
 * chips' space empty, pushing the trailing dropdown away from the last visible
 * chip by a gap that changes with the viewport.
 *
 * A chip's floor is its icon-only form — the state dot, unread badge and padding
 * are all `shrink-0` — so a cut is still reachable once even those do not fit.
 * That cut is marked on the EDGE, never over the chips: an alpha fade across the
 * last pixels reads as a rendering fault rather than as an affordance, because
 * the unread badge is a chip's trailing element and is therefore the first thing
 * any cut reaches — a fade there dissolves the one glyph the chip exists to show.
 * `data-cut` drives a 1px rule at the boundary (index.css), and the count itself
 * survives twice over: the cut crew's unread is already rolled into the dropdown
 * trigger's aggregate badge, and its dropdown pin announces the cut in its own
 * accessible name (`pinned_no_room`).
 *
 * The row needs no width cap of its own: it sits in the topbar's left grid track
 * (`minmax(0,1fr)`) inside `.tb-left`, which carries `min-width:0` and
 * `overflow:hidden`, so the track already prevents it from reaching the centered
 * search column.
