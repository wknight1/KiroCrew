/**
 * "Ask the agent" — turns a dead-end error message into a chat that already
 * knows what broke.
 *
 * This is an AI agent app: an error the user cannot fix themselves is usually
 * one the agent can, so no error surface should be a dead end. The button
 * carries the full structured context (route, endpoint, HTTP status, backend
 * `code`, raw body) into the composer, not just the sentence already on screen.
 *
 * Two ways to supply that context:
 *  - `report` — a structured {@link ErrorReport}, when the caller has one;
 *  - `message` — just the string, when it does not. The report is then recovered
 *    from the error journal by message match, which is what makes this droppable
 *    into the ~80 existing ad-hoc `setError(e.message)` sites unchanged.
 *
 * **Deliberately hook-free.** Its most important callers are ErrorBoundary
 * fallbacks, and a boundary is exactly where the store or router may be the
 * thing that threw — so requiring `<Provider>`/`<Router>` context would make the
 * button unavailable in the case it matters most. Navigation goes through the
 * `installSoftNavigate` seam in `utils/errorReport`, which degrades to a full
 * page load instead of throwing.

 *
 * Takes the message and resolves the journal entry HERE, at call time, for the

 * report only after React has already rendered this fallback.
