 *
 * Minimum one decimal so the column reads as a consistent set of rates rather
 * than a mix of "1" and "2.2" — this matches kiro.dev's own comparison table,
 * which writes 1.0x / 2.2x / 0.25x / 0.05x.
 *
 * Routed through `fmtNumber`, NOT `toFixed`. The digits land inside translated

 * emits Latin digits — wrong for `bn`, which otherwise renders
 * `Auto-এর তুলনায় 2.2x ক্রেডিট খরচ` with a Latin numeral mid-sentence.
 * `website/AGENTS.md` makes the locale seam mandatory ("Never format a date,
 * number, or sort order without naming a locale"), and
 * `website/docs/i18n-catalog.md` names `toFixed` as the case no source scan can
 * detect. `utils/formatCost.ts` is the in-tree precedent.
 *
 * The sub-0.005 branch stays hand-rolled on purpose. `maximumFractionDigits: 2`
 * would flatten anything smaller to "0", and a "0x" badge reads as "this model
 * is free" — the exact misreading `isPricedMultiplier` rejects a literal 0 to
 * avoid. Today's cheapest rate is 0.01x so it is latent, but reading the rate
 * live is precisely an admission that kiro re-prices models. That branch pins
 * its own significant digits and still formats through the locale seam.
