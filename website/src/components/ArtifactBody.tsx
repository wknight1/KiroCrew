 * eviction) re-requests a spent URL and lands the frame on a 404 page. That
 * fires `load` like any other navigation, so without this the user is left with
 * a silent empty box and no affordance, while `failed` stays false because the

 * window `load` (see HEIGHT_REPORTER_BODY) precisely so that a report racing
 * ahead of the load event -- layout settles before images finish -- cannot be
 * the last one; silence past this window therefore means the frame is showing
 * something that is not ours.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT an automatic re-mint: a second `load` also happens when a
 * link inside an artifact navigates the frame, and silently pulling the reader
 * back would fight an action they took. Offering the re-mint is the right
 * response to either cause — in both, the frame has stopped showing the artifact
 * — which is why the window re-arms on EVERY load rather than only on a new url.
 * The two causes cannot be told apart from outside the opaque sandbox, so the
 * notice for this state is cause-neutral ("no longer showing" / "Show artifact")
 * rather than the `failed` state's failure claim. */
