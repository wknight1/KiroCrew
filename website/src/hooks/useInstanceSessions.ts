/**
 * Live sessions from every CONNECTED remote instance, shaped as ordinary
 * Sessions-list rows so they can be MERGED into the local list rather than
 * grouped into a region of their own.
 *
 * WHY MERGED AND NOT SECTIONED: the sidebar already treats origin as a PROPERTY
 * OF A ROW rather than a bucket a row lives in — federated search stamps the
 * peer that answered onto each history row, and the live list already renders a
 * per-row instance badge and a remote activation path. So the honest shape for
 * "see every session together" is one recency-ordered list with the badge doing
 * the distinguishing. A per-instance section would have added a second grammar
 * for something the row model already expresses.
 *
 * WHY `peer_id` AND NOT `instance_id`: a live `Slot` already declares
 * `instance_id`, and it means the OPPOSITE direction of travel — a LOCAL session
 * whose turns are DISPATCHED to a peer (`executor: 'remote'`). These rows are the
 * reverse: sessions the peer already OWNS, which this machine can only read.
 * Reusing the field would have collided in three ways. (1) It is a literal
 * duplicate declaration on one interface, so it does not compile. (2) Every
 * `slot.instance_id` predicate in ChatSidebar — roughly two dozen, covering
 * rename, drag, pin, folder placement, unread, the digit badge and the active
 * highlight — would start reading a remote-EXECUTED local slot as unreachable
 * and strip affordances that still work. (3) A peer's own slot can ITSELF be
 * `executor: 'remote'` bound to a THIRD machine, so overwriting `instance_id`
 * with the answering peer would destroy that binding rather than shadow it.
 * `isPeerRow()` in ChatSidebar is the single reader of these two fields.
 *
 * WHAT IS REACHABLE: the peer's live sessions, through the hub's own owner-only,
 * GET-only `/api/instances/{id}/chat-slots`. That route reads the peer's
 * `GET /api/chat/slots` and then FILTERS it, which is why it exists instead of this
 * hook calling the generic proxy: a local session bound to that peer for EXECUTION
 * (`executor: 'remote'`) is backed by a real slot ON the peer, so the peer lists it
 * alongside its own, and an unfiltered read renders that ONE conversation twice —
 * once as the local row the user can chat in, once as a read-only peer row. Only
 * the gateway can correlate the pair, because the binding's `remote_slot` is
 * deliberately never projected to the browser.
 * A remote instance's OLDER sessions stay out of reach: they live under the peer's
 * `/api/sessions`, which the proxy refuses — and the one prefix row that would
 * admit them would also admit `DELETE /api/sessions`, session-restart, a memory
 * read and a token-spending summarize. So this hook returns LIVE sessions and the
 * caller says so, rather than rendering rows it cannot fill.
 *
 * SORT KEY: the peer's `last_turn_ts` / `last_ts` / `created` ladder is forwarded
 * AS THE RAW ISO FIELDS and nothing is derived from it. `sessionOrder`'s
 * `slotActivityTs` already collapses exactly that ladder in exactly that
 * precedence, and it is what ranking, the date-segment header and the row label
 * each read for a live row — so a second copy here would be one definition of
 * "when did this last move" per file, which is how the two drift.
 *
 * An earlier revision also derived `modified` (epoch seconds) from the ladder, on
 * the belief that the header and label read `modified ?? created` and would
 * otherwise segment a row by its CREATION instant while ranking it by last
 * activity. That was wrong about this list: `modified ?? created` is the HISTORY
 * pane's rule, which a peer row never enters, and `lastActivityEpoch` falls back
 * to `slotActivityTs` when `modified` is absent. Dropping the field changes no
 * ordering and no header — the merge spec's recency-interleave and
 * one-header-per-bucket cases pass either way, which is what retired it.
 *
 * `last_message` is NOT a timestamp: it is an 80-char message PREVIEW string
 * (`slot_projection.py`: `redacted[:80]`). Assigning it to `modified` put a string
 * where a number belongs, made `tb - ta` NaN, and — because NaN makes every
 * comparison false — left the WHOLE merged list in arbitrary order rather than
 * merely misplacing remote rows. Forwarding only ISO fields is what makes that
 * class of mistake unavailable here.
 *
 * BLAST RADIUS: one query per instance, keyed per instance, `retry: false`. An
 * unreachable instance yields its own error and contributes no rows; it can never
 * empty or stall the local list, which is the objection that sank an earlier
 * fully-merged design. Callers surface `failed` plus `failure` through
 * `ErrorNotice` rather than faking rows for an instance that did not answer — a
 * read failure with nothing unsaved to lose, so the agent hand-off is on.
