/**
 * useAutoConnectInstances — proactively brings remote-crew tunnels UP so a crew
 * is live the moment you open the web app, instead of sitting Offline until you
 * click it. This is the "when I use the web app, it tries to connect all my
 * crews" behavior; the backend's own startup revive
 * (_revive_intended_instances) only fires on GATEWAY restart, which never
 * happens on a long-lived Mac after the SSH forwarder dies on sleep — so the
 * frontend has to be the one to notice and re-establish.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *  - After the shared ['instances'] query resolves, and again whenever the tab
 *    regains focus/visibility, it fans `connectInstanceInto` at every crew that
 *    is not already live, bounded by concurrency and the warm-set cap.
 *  - Reuses the SAME connect-and-store unit as manual select
 *    (connectInstanceInto), so an auto-connected pane goes warm through the
 *    exact path a click would take. It NEVER touches `activeId`: tunnels come
 *    up in the background; the user is not yanked to a crew they didn't pick.
 *
 * WHY EACH GUARD EXISTS
 *  - Default-on setting (mc-auto-connect): each connect is a real SSH session +
 *    a remote token mint, so a many-crew user can turn the whole behavior off.
 *  - Per-instance opt-out (mc-auto-connect-exclude): skip a specific crew (a
 *    flaky or rarely-used host) without disabling the rest.
 *  - Warm-set cap: connecting past the cap would only make the viewport evict
 *    an equal number, so we target at most `warmCap` crews and skip any already
 *    connected — no thrash.
 *  - Per-instance cooldown: focus/visibility can fire in bursts (window manager
 *    churn, tab thrashing); a short cooldown keeps a burst from spamming mints
 *    at the same host. A genuinely-dropped tunnel is retried once the cooldown
 *    elapses.
 *  - Embedded panes never run this: an embedded pane shows no switcher and must
 *    not connect onward (see isEmbeddedPane).
 *
 * Registered ONCE from App.tsx (like useInstanceShortcuts), never inside a
 * component that can mount more than once.
