/**
 * The compaction card's shadow line, and the reader behind it.
 *
 * Two things this file is about, because either one alone would let a wrong number
 * onto the screen: the reader refuses a record whose parts do not add up, and the
 * line draws on every shape the compaction card takes (a success notice, a recycle
 * notice, and the ⚠-led failure that renders through ErrorNotice) — the scoring runs
 * before the compaction picks an arm, so all three are reachable with a record.
