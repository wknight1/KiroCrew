/**
 * When the picker offers `Auto (Jev)`, and when it reads as selected.
 *
 * Both gates are asserted as FAIL-CLOSED, which is the whole point of the module:
 * the fleet's `decisions_enabled` and the owner's keystone consent are different
 * answers, and offering the row on either alone puts a paid third-party call one
 * click away from someone who did not agree to one. Neither read is an enforcement
 * point — the gate re-checks both — so these tests pin presentation, not security.
 *
 * The selected-state half matters just as much: a routed slot stores `model: 'auto'`,
 * so a picker highlighting on the model alone would tick the Auto row and name a
 * behaviour the session does not have.
