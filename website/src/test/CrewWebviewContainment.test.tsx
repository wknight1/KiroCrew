/**
 * Containment ratchet for a crew's webview.
 *
 * A crew fills this in on an unattended loop while reading issue bodies,
 * pull-request descriptions and review comments, so a path exists from a hostile
 * issue body to this component. There are now TWO views on that path and they
 * are contained by different mechanisms, which is why this file asserts both:
 *
 * - DOCKED is native React. Crew strings are text children, so they cannot
 *   become markup at all. Stronger than a sandbox, and the assertion is that no
 *   element appears from a payload that is trying to open one.
 * - EXPANDED is the sandboxed document, and its containment is one attribute.
 *   The frame is STRICTER than the artifact frame whose plumbing it borrows: the
 *   gateway route serves one CSP `sandbox` header for every consumer and that
 *   header grants popups — but sandbox restrictions COMBINE rather than union,
 *   so a grant the frame attribute withholds stays withheld. Asserting the exact
 *   attribute string is therefore asserting the effective sandbox.
 *
 * The third property here is the MINT COUNT, and it is the one a reader would
 * not guess. The minted URL is single-use server-side, so the frame is minted on
 * first expand and then kept mounted behind a hidden wrapper: zero mints docked,
 * one at first expand, still one after expand -> collapse -> expand.
