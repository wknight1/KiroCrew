/**
 * The strip's reader, held against the record the spec pins.
 *
 * `decisionRecord.ts` fails safe by drawing nothing, and that state is
 * byte-identical to a healthy release which stamps no record at all. So if the
 * gateway half renames a field, respells a key or changes the feedback
 * vocabulary, the strip would simply stop appearing — no exception, no failing
 * test, and the feature would look like it had never been wired.
 *
 * This suite closes that hole from the side it can reach. It parses the record
 * fixture out of `docs/system-specs/modules/decisions.md` § 8 — the document
 * both halves are written against — and asserts the reader accepts it field for
 * field. A change to the spec without the matching reader change is now a red
 * test here, and a reader change that drops a field the spec still promises is
 * red too.
 *
 * It reads the spec rather than restating it on purpose: a copy of the fixture
 * in this file would be a second contract, free to drift from the one the
 * backend author reads.
