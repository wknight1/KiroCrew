/**
 * Voice dictation for ONE composer — chat-core P3-b (composer layer).
 *
 * Everything a host needs to give its `ChatInput` a working microphone: the STT
 * config read, the `useVoiceInput` engine, caret-anchored transcript splicing,
 * the disarm flags that keep a late partial/final out of a composer the user
 * already sent or cancelled, the slot-switch teardown, and the "voice needs
 * setting up" modal state. Extracted verbatim from `ChatPage` so a second host
 * (`ChatPane`: split panes, Crew Members DMs) mounts the same behaviour instead
 * of a copy.
 *
 * What stays with the host, injected through `ComposerVoiceHost`:
 *   - the composer's text (`inputRef` + `setInput`);
 *   - whether its composer is the one on screen for a session
 *     (`isComposerFor`) — ChatPage has one composer over many slots and answers
 *     with its draft-settlement refs, a pane's composer IS its slot's;
 *   - what to do with a batch transcript for a session whose composer is not on
 *     screen (`deliverOffScreen`) — ChatPage appends it to that slot's persisted
 *     draft; a host without a draft store omits it and the text is dropped, the
 *     legacy off-screen streaming behaviour;
 *   - the endpointer's auto-submit (`onAutoSubmit`);
 *   - whether to own the global push-to-talk key binding (`pushToTalk`) —
 *     exactly one host per document, or a keystroke opens N microphones.
 *
 * ONE MIC. The engine is per instance, so a second instance would happily open a
 * second capture. A module-level owner slot makes capture exclusive across every
 * mounted composer: `startVoice` refuses while another instance holds it, and
 * `micBusyElsewhere` lets the host render its controls as busy — the same
 * treatment `voiceTranscribeActive` already gives a transcription in flight
 * (which is global through the inbox, see voiceTranscriptInbox).
