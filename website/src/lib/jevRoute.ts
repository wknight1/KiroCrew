/** The chat model picker's `Auto (Jev)` entry: when it is offered, and when it is on.
 *
 *  The entry is not a model. Picking it asks the `model.route` decision point to
 *  put each turn in a difficulty tier and to run that turn on the model the tier
 *  maps to (`decisions.model_route`); until it answers, the session runs on the
 *  backend's own default. So the id below never reaches a provider — the gateway
 *  resolves it to `auto` and records the choice as the slot's `jev_route` flag —
 *  and the slot's own `model` keeps meaning "a provider model id" everywhere.
 *
 *  Two conditions gate the row, and BOTH are required, because they answer
 *  different questions:
 *
 *  - `decisions_enabled` on `GET /api/dashboard/config` is the FLEET's answer
 *    (`capabilities.decisions`, resolved server-side). Fail closed on `=== true`:
 *    an absent field is an older gateway or a read that has not landed.
 *  - `enabled` on `GET /api/decisions/consent` is the OWNER's answer, the keystone.
 *    Offering the row without it would put a paid third-party call one click away
 *    from a user who never consented to one.
 *
 *  Neither read is an enforcement point — the gate re-checks both, and a request
 *  carrying the sentinel against an unconsented keystone simply routes nothing —
 *  so this module is presentation only. It lives here rather than in one page
 *  because two surfaces draw the picker (ChatPage and each split ChatPane), and a
 *  second copy of the condition is a second place for them to disagree about
 *  whether the row is offered.

 *  with no live slot is held as the pending model and forwarded verbatim into
 *  slot creation, which would store the sentinel as the new slot's model -- an
 *  id no provider serves -- with routing off. It is a parameter rather than a
 *  check inside each page so both surfaces answer the same question here.
