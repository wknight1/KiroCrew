/**
 * The read model behind the transcript's decision strip.
 *
 * The gateway stamps one record on the row a decision shaped. A turn whose skill
 * set was chosen by asking Jev (`decisions/points/skills_select.py`) carries it on
 * the ASSISTANT row that ends the turn; a message whose mid-turn handling was
 * chosen (`decisions/points/message_steer.py`) carries it on that message's own
 * USER row, because that is what the decision was about; a compaction whose tool calls
 * were scored in the shadow (`decisions/points/compaction_keep.py`) carries it on the
 * compaction notice row, for the same reason. All three render from the
 * record and nothing else: neither makes a request of its own to learn what
 * happened, so a transcript reloaded from disk and one that arrived live say the
 * same thing.
 *
 * Which record a payload is comes from its own `point`, never from which fields
 * happen to be present: an absent point reads as `skills.select`, which is what
 * the only earlier producer stamped, and a named point this reader does not know
 * draws nothing rather than being guessed at as the older shape.
 *
 * Every field is validated here rather than at the render site, for the reason
 * `decisionsPreview.ts` gives about consent: this payload names what left the
 * machine and what came back, and a strip that prints a shape it did not check
 * would describe a decision nobody made. A record that fails validation renders
 * nothing at all — the absent-field path — because a half-drawn receipt is worse
 * than no receipt.
 *
 * The gateway stamps the record under `meta` on the assistant row, and `meta`
 * is what both doors carry: the live websocket frame and a row reloaded from
 * history. The row's own top level is read too, the same split
 * `CompactionCard.noticeKindOf` reads `kind` through, so a producer that stamps
 * the key there is understood rather than silently ignored.
 *
 * The stem is `decisionRecord`, not `decisionStrip`, so it cannot differ from
 * `DecisionStrip.tsx` beside it in case alone. A case-only pair resolves to ONE
 * module on a case-insensitive filesystem, so every import of both breaks on
 * macOS and Windows while a Linux checkout compiles — see the guard in
 * `test/fileNameCasing.test.ts`.
