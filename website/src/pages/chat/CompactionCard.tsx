/**
 * The gateway appends every compaction outcome as an ASSISTANT-role row tagged
 * `kind="compaction"`. The tag is shared by every writer that wants the row
 * skipped by the last-real-message scans (see lib/systemNotice.ts), so the
 * content is one of a closed set of shapes, not one:
 *
 *   ✅ Conversation compacted: <summary>     kiro-cli's /compaction/status
 *   ✅ Conversation compacted.               no summary (Claude backend, manual)
 *   ❌ Compaction failed: <reason>           first failures of a streak
 *   ❌ Compaction has failed Nx in a row …   the streak's collapsed notice
 *   ⚠️ Compaction timed out.                 the manual /compact wait
 *   ⚠ Auto-compact failed at N% — …          threshold auto-compact (state.py)
 *   🔄 Auto-compacted at N%.                  threshold auto-compact, success
 *   ♻️ This session was recycled …           watchdog recycle notice
 *   ⏳ This turn has produced nothing …       stuck-turn notice
 *
 * Only the first is a document worth folding: on kiro-cli `<summary>` is the
 * backend's whole context digest (Goal / Status / Technical / Decisions …),
 * routinely several kilobytes. Drawn as a bubble it reads as a reply the
 * assistant never made and pushes the real conversation off-screen.
 *
 * Parsed on the frontend, at render time, so no history row needs rewriting:
 * a transcript persisted by any gateway since the notice existed gets the card.
 *
 * One row of that set can also carry a `meta.decisions_strip` record from the
 * `compaction.keep` shadow point, and every shape above can: the scoring runs before
 * the compaction picks an arm, so the record outlives whichever arm it took. That
 * record draws one line UNDER whatever the card drew (`CompactionKeepLine`), saying
 * what an oracle WOULD have kept — nothing was kept, and the compaction is identical
 * whatever it answered.

 * folded behind a chevron; expanding it renders the summary as markdown inside
 * a capped, internally scrolling region so a 20 KB summary cannot take the
 * viewport. No chevron and no button when there is nothing to expand.
 *
 * A failure is not folded: it renders through ErrorNotice (the shared error
 * surface, AUTOSDE errors-use-error-notice), because a compaction that failed
 * is the outcome of something that FAILED — that covers the ❌ rows AND the
 * ⚠-led "Auto-compact failed" / "Compaction timed out" rows, since the rule
 * classifies by where the text comes from, not by its glyph. The agent hand-off
 * is deliberately off (see the failed branch). Every other shape the tag
 * carries — the threshold auto-compact success line, the recycle and stuck-turn
 * notices — is status, not a document and not a failure, and draws on
 * NoticeCard.
