/**
 * The compaction card's receipt for one SHADOW scoring of that compaction.
 *
 * A compaction discards everything the harness does not summarize, and today's
 * recycle replay keeps the conversation text alone — every tool call and every tool
 * result is already gone. This line says what an oracle would have kept instead, and
 * it is the only place that number is visible: the compaction itself is byte-identical
 * whatever Jev answered, so without the line the measurement would exist only in a
 * log file.
 *
 * ONE line, not a disclosure card. Everything the record holds fits on it — how many
 * of the session's tool calls would have been kept, what share of the conversation's
 * characters that is, and (only on a session whose walk overflowed) how many calls
 * were never scored — and a collapsed card that hides nothing is a control that does
 * nothing (the same reasoning `SteerDecisionLine` states).
 *
 * The overflow qualifier sits INSIDE the count's own clause rather than beside the
 * character share, because it qualifies that count and nothing else: the share is
 * measured over the characters the arms did cover, so "(+K not scored)" trailing the
 * whole line would read as a caveat on both numbers.
 *
 * It says "would", not "did", and that wording is load-bearing rather than cautious:
 * nothing was kept. A reader who took this for a description of what the compaction
 * did would believe their tool history survived it.
 *
 * The record on the row is the ONLY condition, the rule the other two receipts share:
 * a stamped record is history that already sits on this machine, so drawing it sends
 * nothing, and gating it on the current consent switch would lose the receipt for
 * every past compaction the moment the preview is turned off.
 *
 * The thumbs are `DecisionStrip`'s own pair, shared rather than copied. Side `jev`:
 * the record names one answer by one party, and the arm it is compared against is a
 * replay rule with no opinion to rate.
