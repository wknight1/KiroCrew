/**
 * The Decisions (Jev) card in Settings > Developer > Feature Previews.
 *
 * What is under test is the one thing this card does differently from every
 * other preview in that section: its switch is the KEYSTONE
 * `decisions_consent.json`, read and written through `/api/decisions/consent`,
 * not a per-device localStorage flag and not a `config.json` value. So the cases
 * are the states a backend-backed switch can be in — read pending, read failed,
 * gateway too old (404), consent off, consent on, write failed — and the claim
 * in each is the same one: the card never offers a write it cannot make, and
 * never stays silent about why. The sampling share still comes from
 * `config.json`, so the two reads are stubbed separately.
 *
 * A third read decides whether the card exists at all: `GET /api/dashboard/config`
 * reports `decisions_enabled`, the `capabilities.decisions` governance answer, and
 * a fleet that pinned the seam off gets no card — see the last block.
