/**
 * The Decisions (Jev) card's read model.
 *
 * Two sources, deliberately, because the two values live in two different
 * places on the gateway and the split IS the security design:
 *
 * - **Consent** — whether Jev may be asked at all — is the KEYSTONE
 *   `decisions_consent.json`, read and written through `/api/decisions/consent`.
 *   It is not a config path: `config.json` is writable by an auto-approved agent
 *   shell, so a switch there could be flipped by a prompt-injected agent and the
 *   live config watcher would start sending message text off the machine. The
 *   keystone is mounted read-only in every sandbox and its only writer is the
 *   owner-only dashboard handler behind this card.
 * - **The sampling share** — `decisions.bucket` — comes from `config.json` through
 *   the ordinary config GET. It grants nothing on its own (it can only narrow what
 *   consent allows), so it stays a config value.
 *
 * Nothing is inferred from a legacy `decisions.preview` / `points.*.arm` section:
 * that experiment sampled for COMPARISON and is retired; reading its values as
 * consent would turn on egress from a value nobody wrote for it.
