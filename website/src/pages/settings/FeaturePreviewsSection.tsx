/**
 * Settings > Developer > Feature Previews — opt in to surfaces that ship in the
 * bundle but are not released yet (see `utils/previewFlags.ts`).
 *
 * Formerly its own tab on the standalone Developer page (`/developer`). It moved
 * here because the switch that HOLDS an unreleased feature belongs next to the
 * switch that REVEALS the developer tooling (Developer Mode, one section up):
 * both are consent gates, and a reader looking for "how do I turn the unfinished
 * thing on" looks in Settings, not on an internals page they first have to
 * unlock. `DeveloperPage.tsx` redirects the old
 * `/developer?tab=feature-previews` link here.
 *
 * The USER-FACING copy says "features" and "pages", never "surfaces": `Surface`
 * is the registry's internal term and means nothing to the operator reading the
 * toggle. The component and catalog keys keep the code vocabulary on purpose —
 * they name the mechanism, not the copy. The catalog keys also keep their
 * historical `pages.developer.featurePreviewsTab.*` namespace: renaming seven
 * keys across fourteen catalogs buys no user-visible change, and the section
 * itself still describes the developer-tooling gate it started as.
 *
 * ONE CARD PER FEATURE, and everything that belongs to a feature lives inside
 * its card: the headline, the sentence explaining what state it is in, its
 * toggle, and any ingress that only appears once it is on. A reader scanning the
 * section can then take a card as the whole story of one preview, rather than
 * pairing a row against an ingress rendered somewhere below it.
 *
 * One explicit card per preview flag rather than a loop over a table: the copy
 * has to be a static `i18nT('literal')` call for `check-i18n-keys.mjs` to
 * resolve it, and a table of key strings indexed per card is exactly the dynamic
 * pattern that gate cannot follow. A preview flag is also meant to be
 * short-lived, so the cost of a card is paid once and then deleted with it.
 *
 * Under `pages/settings/` ON PURPOSE, reversing the old tab's stance:
 * `gen-settings-registry.mjs` scans this directory, so these toggles ARE
 * indexed into Settings search (`PANEL_TAB_MAP` maps this file to `developer`).
 * The old tab kept itself out of the index so that searching "webhooks" would
 * not advertise a hidden page. In Settings the calculus flips: a control the
 * user can see on a Settings pane but cannot find through Settings search is
 * the exact coverage gap the settings-coverage gate exists to close, and what
 * the search hit reaches is the opt-in switch — labelled as a preview — not the
 * page it holds. The PAGE stays un-advertised: `getAdvertisedSurfaces()` and
 * the Search Everywhere Pages provider still filter it until the flag is on.
 *
 * No `configKey` on the four `previewFlags.ts` toggles, deliberately: that prop
 * is what makes a `<SettingRef>` chip deep-link here and what feeds
 * `settingsRegistry.gen.ts`, and a per-device localStorage flag has no config
 * path to name at all. Search deep-links still reach every toggle through its
 * registry id + `data-setting-label`, which need no configKey.
 *
 * The Decisions toggle below carries no `configKey` either, for a different
 * reason: it writes no config path. Its value is the KEYSTONE
 * `decisions_consent.json`, reached through `/api/decisions/consent`, because
 * `config.json` is writable by an auto-approved agent shell and consent to send
 * message text off the machine must not be (see `decisionsPreview.ts`). A
 * `configKey` naming a config path nothing reads would be the drift the
 * `test_settingref_schema_fixture.py` guard exists to catch, so its absence here
 * is asserted by `decisionsPreview.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each card may also carry a "See what it looks like" button (`FeaturePreviewIntroButton`)
 * opening a dialog with a REAL capture of the surface the flag reveals, a
 * sentence on what it does, where it appears once on, and the same switch again.
 * The intro is defined right here next to its card — the card IS the preview's
 * definition — as a render-time builder rather than a table of catalog keys,
 * for the same `check-i18n-keys.mjs` reason the cards are not a loop: the gate
 * resolves a literal `i18nT('…')`, not a key read out of a nested object. A
 * preview whose surface has not been captured yet (below: "Chat on a crew",
 * whose menu entry only exists with a live tunnel to a second machine, which an
 * isolated capture instance cannot honestly stage) simply has no builder and so
 * no button — never a dialog with an empty frame.

/**
 * Decisions (Jev): the one card here whose switch is BACKEND state.
 *
 * The other four previews are `previewFlags.ts` keys — per-device localStorage,
 * because what they hold is a page this browser either draws or does not. This
 * one holds a gate that runs in the GATEWAY, which cannot read this browser's
 * localStorage — and it is consent to send message text to a paid external
 * service, so it is not a `config.json` value either: that file is writable by
 * an auto-approved agent shell. The switch reads and writes the keystone
 * `decisions_consent.json` through the owner-only `/api/decisions/consent` pair,
 * the same shape as the AWS consent surface. The sampling share still comes from
 * `config.json` (`['kirocrewConfig']`, shared with every other config reader),
 * because narrowing what consent allows grants nothing on its own.
 *
 * What the switch does: for the share of sessions `decisions.bucket` admits, Jev's
 * answer at `skills.select` decides which skill a message loads. A failure, a
 * timeout or a refusal falls back to the word-matching rule the build ships with,
 * which is why the copy promises a fallback rather than an outage.
 *
 * `decisions.preview` is NOT read as a fallback for the field — see
 * `decisionsPreview.ts`. A gateway carrying only that field is reported as
 * unsupported, with the same disabled switch and reason a pre-`decisions`
 * gateway gets.
 *
 * No `configKey`: the switch writes no config path (see the section's doc
 * comment above).
 *
 * Above the owner's switch sits the FLEET's. `capabilities.decisions` is a
 * governance ceiling resolved server-side and reported as `decisions_enabled` on
 * `GET /api/dashboard/config`; a fleet that pinned the seam off gets NO CARD, not
 * a disabled one, because a ceiling is not a state the user can act on. The
 * refusal itself is the consent PUT (403) and the gate's own consent read — this
 * is presentation, and it is deliberately the only state here that hides rather
 * than explains.
 *
 * The point row is READ-ONLY on purpose. It names the one thing Jev decides in
 * plain words, with the backend's identifier beside it for a reader matching the
 * card against the decision log. It carries no on/off state of its own — the
 * switch above is that state, and printing it twice read as two controls. The
 * sampling share is a setting an operator moves in `config.json`
 * (`decisions.bucket`), so the sampling line names that path instead of offering
 * a second control. It is printed whether the switch is on or off, phrased as
 * "while this is on": a reader deciding whether to consent needs to know that
 * the shipped default is every session, before flipping the switch, not after.
 *
 * NO "See what it looks like" button, and that is the missing-capture rule the
 * "Chat on a crew" card below states, not an omission: this preview draws no
 * surface at all. What it changes is which skills load, and the receipts are
 * lines in a log file.

          each keeps a reader from flipping the wrong switch.

          NO ingress button, for the same reason as the crew card: turning it on
          puts the create-menu entry back in the same tick, and that menu is
          already in front of the user.

          NO "See what it looks like" yet either, and that is the missing-capture rule, not
          an omission: the entry it adds only renders while a tunnel to a second
          machine is live (`warmCrews.length > 0` in ChatSidebar), and the
          isolated instance the captures come from has no honest way to stage
          one. A dialog with a staged or drawn frame would break the promise the
          other two dialogs make — that what you see is what will appear. Add a
          builder here the day a real two-machine capture exists. */}

          NO ingress button, and for a different reason than the crew cards: they
          omit it because their door is already on screen, whereas this preview
          has no page of its own at all — it changes the Sessions list every user
