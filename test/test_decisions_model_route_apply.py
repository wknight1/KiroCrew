"""The apply path: what the PROVIDER is handed when Jev answers a tier.

This is the load-bearing suite for ``model.route``. Everything else about the point
is observable from its own return value, but "the turn actually ran on the model the
tier names" is not: nothing downstream can tell "Jev said complex" from "the session
happened to be on that model already". So these tests drive the real runner hook
against a recording client and assert the id ``set_model`` received.

Two mutation checks sit beside the happy path and are what make it more than a
tautology. One breaks the tier-to-model MAP and asserts the provider is handed the
new id; the other changes the ANSWER and asserts the provider follows it. A hook
that ignored either -- switching to a hardcoded model, or switching on nothing --
passes a single happy-path assertion and fails both of these.

The rest is WHOSE turn gets routed. The point runs for a normal dashboard chat turn
of a slot whose owner picked ``Auto (Jev)``, and for nothing else: a cron delivery,
a sub-agent turn, an app injection and an autonudge wake each already resolve their
model through their own tier, and none of them has an owner watching the price.
