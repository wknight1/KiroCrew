"""Regression tests for the three Arbiter BLOCK items in cron locking.

Item 1 — the app-facing ``CronSDK`` mutation API stays **sync-callable** with
         its published contract; a prior revision flipped
         ``add_job``/``remove_job``/``update_job``/``remove_all`` to ``async def``
         with no shim, silently turning ``ctx.cron.add_job(...)`` into an
         un-awaited coroutine (data-losing break). Separately-named ``*_async``
         siblings serve loop-native callers.

Item 2 — ``CronSDK.remove_all`` removes every owned job in ONE atomic
         ``CronService`` batch transaction and PROPAGATES ``CronStoreBusy``: a
         contended store removes them all or none (never a partial removal that
         orphans still-ENABLED jobs) and the failure is surfaced, not masked as
         a successful ``0``. The owned set is SELECTED inside the same locked
         transaction (against the reloaded on-disk state), not from a cache-only
         id snapshot, so a job the app created in another process since the last
         cache refresh is still removed — no cross-process orphan window.

Item 3 — the store lock's loop-safety invariant is MACHINE-ENFORCED:
         ``_file_lock`` raises ``CronLoopSafetyError`` on a running event loop
         under strict mode, while the sanctioned async / offloaded-sync paths
         do NOT trip it. Runs in CI, so a future writer that reintroduces an
         on-loop sync-mutator call on a sanctioned path is caught.
