"""The AI cleanup pass on a finished transcript, and the guards that keep it safe.

Three properties carry the feature, and each has tests here:

* The switch IS the consent. ``stt.polish`` is off by default and the endpoint
  refuses while it is off, because the local provider's promise is that nothing
  leaves the machine and this is what sends the transcript off it.
* It can never lose or invent what the user said. A model reply that fails the
  length guard is discarded and the original is returned, so the worst outcome is
  the recogniser's own text rather than a rewrite.
* It never blocks dictation, which is why it is an endpoint rather than a frame on
  the speech websocket -- that socket closes shortly after the final, so a
  correction routed through it would be cancelled in the commonest case of all.
