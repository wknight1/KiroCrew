"""Tests for Issue Radar's crew HTTP surface (``backend/crew_routes.py``).

Every test calls the **registered** handler — looked up out of a real
``web.Application`` by method and path — rather than the bare function. That is
deliberate: it means each happy path also proves the route exists at the verb and
path the contract names, and that it is wrapped in both the ``_require_enabled``
gate and the ``CrewStoreError -> 409`` guard. A route that is written but never
registered, or registered without a gate, fails here instead of in production.

The coverage is weighted toward the conditions whose failure is otherwise silent:

  * **The gates.** All 13 routes are asserted denied when the app is disabled and
    404 when the repo is not connected — as a table, so a route added later
    without a gate fails the inventory test rather than shipping open.
  * **409, never 500.** A duplicate crew name and a second item entering an
    editing phase are ordinary user conditions; surfaced as 500 they read as "the
    backend broke" and a crew agent retries them forever.
  * **The ledger cannot lie.** ``PUT /crew/work`` writes the item and appends the
    event in one call, and a refused write must leave NO ledger line behind.
  * **A skip is always indexed.** ``phase: skipped`` through ``PUT /crew/work``
    writes the repo-wide shared index in the same request. That is the load-bearing
    invariant of the index: if a pass can be recorded without indexing it, every
    other crew re-investigates the issue, which is the waste the index exists to
    remove. Asserted from ANOTHER crew's ``GET /crew``, because visible-to-me is
    not the property — visible-to-the-fleet is.
  * **``working`` is the NEWEST open item**, not any of them — the difference only
    shows up on a crew holding one parked and one active item.
  * **Nothing waits for a human.** There is no route through which a person answers
    a crew and no queue of items held for one, so the tests assert those endpoints
    are GONE rather than that they behave — a crew that needs a decision labels the
    issue, records the pass and releases its claim.

Data isolation is one patch: ``routes._scope`` is the only thing that decides
where crew records land, so pointing it at a ``TemporaryDirectory`` keeps every
store write inside the test. Nothing here touches the network or a real data home.
