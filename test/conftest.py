    ``build_pump(n)`` returns an input with an ``n``-unit pump (a run of tabs, ``n``

    outcome (a refusal, or the one legitimate match the shape has). Replaces the
    ``elapsed < 1.0`` wall-clock shape, which flaked in one of five full runs:
    ``perf_counter`` charges the time this worker spent DESCHEDULED behind nine
    siblings to a regex that took 0.15 s of CPU (class 5 in testing-conventions),
    and a ``monotonic()`` ratio read 16x from a 15.6 ms clock tick. Four properties:

    * **Thread CPU, not wall clock.** ``time.thread_time`` counts this thread's
      own execution, so another worker's slice cannot inflate it; the regex runs
      in C, so coverage instrumentation does not either.
    * **A one-unit ramp FIRST, and it is what catches the real regression.** A
      shared character between two adjacent quantified classes in these grammars
      is not polynomial but EXPONENTIAL (measured: 0.27 s at 20 characters, 4.3 s
      at 24, doubling per character; an interior that admits every bracket grows
      ~8x per block), so the 200 000-character input the old tests used would never
      return under a regression and the worker would be killed at ``--timeout`` --
      a lost run (class 6), not a red test. Ramping one unit at a time means the
      first over-budget size costs at most ~growth x budget, and the assertion
      fires there; only when the whole ramp passes is a long pump tried at all.
    * **Ascending long pumps** for the polynomial class, so a cubic overruns at
      2 000 before 20 000 is attempted.
    * **Minimum of two readings, and the second is taken only if the first
      overran.** A gen-2 garbage collection charged to this thread mid-search is
      the one thing that can still spend CPU here; it cannot hit two consecutive
      readings, so a first reading under budget is a verdict on its own and two
      over-budget readings are a verdict the other way -- the measurement never
      pays a regression's cost more than twice per size.

    The budgets are generous on purpose (a decade or more over the shipped cost):
    a real complexity regression is orders of magnitude, and a tight bound only

    ``SessionManager._cleanup_loop`` task, etc.) is garbage-collected, calls
    ``tracemalloc_message()`` which runs ``import tracemalloc`` *from inside the
    GC callback*. If ``tracemalloc`` has not been imported yet, that first import
    lands in a partially-initialized state (a CPython circular-import artifact
    observed on 3.12) and raises ``AttributeError: partially initialized module
    'tracemalloc' has no attribute 'get_object_traceback'``. pytest then re-raises
    it as ``RuntimeError: Failed to process unraisable exception`` and reports it
    as an ERROR at the *next* test's setup — turning a benign "object was never
    awaited" warning into a hard build failure that lands on an innocent test.

    Importing the module eagerly here (once per xdist worker, before any test
    runs or any GC fires) makes the hook's ``import tracemalloc`` a no-op
    ``sys.modules`` hit against a fully-built module, so leaks degrade back to
    warnings instead of failing the suite. Touch ``get_object_traceback`` to
    force full initialization and to keep the import from reading as unused.

def _restore_default_child_watcher():
    """Restore a FRESH ThreadedChildWatcher after every test.

    Some tests install a real, non-default asyncio child watcher via the
    gateway's ``_install_child_watcher()`` -- notably
    ``test_cli.py::test_real_subprocess_works_after_install_on_linux``, which on
    Linux installs a ``PidfdChildWatcher`` and runs ``asyncio.run``. On exit,
    ``asyncio.run`` detaches the watcher's loop, leaving a loop-less watcher in
    the global policy. Two distinct failures follow from that leak, and which
    one bites depends purely on xdist sharding, so adding or removing unrelated
    tests can flip a green run red with no production-code change:

    * On 3.10 the leaked watcher's ``is_active()`` is False, so the NEXT
      subprocess-spawning test fails with "asyncio.get_child_watcher() is not
      activated, subprocess support is not available".
    * On 3.12 the leaked watcher is still ATTACHED to callbacks bound to a loop
      that later closes. ``set_event_loop`` calls ``watcher.attach_loop()``,
      which reaps already-exited children and fires their callbacks -- against
      the closed loop -- raising ``RuntimeError: Event loop is closed``. Since
      pytest-asyncio calls ``set_event_loop`` when setting up every test that
      needs a loop, ONE leaked watcher fails every later test in that worker.

    The condition is therefore derived from whether the watcher API EXISTS, not
    from a version number: child watchers were only DEPRECATED in 3.12 and are
    removed in 3.14. A previous ``sys.version_info >= (3, 12): return`` guard
    skipped this cleanup on exactly the version where the second failure mode
    lives, which is what turned one leaked watcher into thousands of cascading
    failures in a full parallel run.

    (``cached_admission_check``, which refuses while the cgroup-clamped reading
    is CRITICAL). Both read the host the suite happens to be running on, so
    without this the verdict is the operator's machine rather than the test's
    own input.

    The failure it produces is misleading, which is why it is worth a shared
    fixture: a refusal IS a ``SubagentInfo`` -- a done one carrying ``error`` --
    so ``assert info is not None`` still passes and the test dies one line later
    on ``mgr._tasks[info.id]`` with a bare ``KeyError``. Measured on a CI runner
    with ~0.5 GB free.

    Only the HOST reading is pinned: a caller that names its own ``path`` is
    feeding the ``/proc/meminfo`` parser a fixture file rather than asking about
    this machine, so it still runs the real function and a parser regression
    still goes red. A test that is actually ABOUT either guard patches it in its
    own body, which lands on top of this and reverts to it.

    ``mcp_tools.control._emit_directive`` publishes every directive out of band
    via ``mcp_core._post("/api/session-directive", ...)`` on the resolved API
    port and swallows every exception — so a test that emits a directive
    without stubbing ``_post`` makes a REAL request to whatever is listening
    there, silently. On a developer machine that is the operator's own live
    gateway, and the request carries a real-looking session key. The suite only
    avoided a live write because this conftest's ``KIROCREW_HOME`` pin makes
    the client read a different instance credential, so the gateway refuses the
    call — an unrelated guard no test is entitled to rely on. Stubbing here
    makes reaching the network opt-in for the whole suite rather than opt-out.

    A RECORDER rather than a black hole, so the stub also buys coverage: the
    out-of-band publish is half of the directive contract (marker + parked
    record), and a test can request this fixture by name and assert on the
    ``(path, payload)`` records. The payload is round-tripped through JSON so a
    non-serializable body fails HERE — the point where the real ``_post`` would
    have failed (and ``_emit_directive`` would have silently swallowed it). The
    stub returns ``{}``: falsy for ``.get("ok")`` readers and free of
    ``"error"``, it invents no success shape the real ``_post`` never promised.

    Opting back in stays explicit and layered: a test's own
    ``monkeypatch.setattr(mcp_core, "_post", ...)`` simply replaces this stub
    for that test, and a module that owns direct coverage of ``_post``'s own
    plumbing lists itself in ``_REAL_MCP_POST_MODULES``. For those modules the
    transport is replaced with a refuser instead (their per-test transport
    patches override it), so the no-traffic property holds per test rather

    can await an event that test will never set, which under ``-n auto`` reads as
    a timeout in a file that never mentioned the seam. Nothing legitimately
    leaves it set, so this restores AND fails.

    Checked on the way IN, not at teardown, and that is not a preference. The
    supported way to set the hook is ``monkeypatch``, whose undo is registered
    against the shared ``monkeypatch`` fixture -- and that fixture is built early,

    one. A teardown-side check therefore cannot tell a pending undo from a real
    leak and fails every legitimate test. Entry-side, the only thing that can

    than the one that leaked it, so the message says so.
