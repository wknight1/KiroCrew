"""Arrival provenance filing — the folder resolution behind an arriving session.

Unit-level cover for :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.arrival_folders`. The handler's own
use of it (both arrival routes, the late resolution, the mid-import repair) is
pinned in ``test/test_session_transfer.py``; what is pinned HERE is the resolution
itself, and specifically the five folder-lifecycle constraints
``docs/request-for-change/rfc-arrival-provenance-filing.md`` §5 records. Each of
those constraints is a real defect class in the folder lifecycle rather than in
the filing idea, which is why each one has its own test below.

The store stub models ``DashboardState.mutate_folders`` / ``read_folders``
faithfully in the one way that matters for these tests: the mutator runs against
the live list under a notional lock and its ``(changed, value)`` pair is the
contract. A stub that let two mutators interleave would make the atomicity
assertion below unfalsifiable, so the transaction COUNT is asserted instead of
simulated concurrency.
