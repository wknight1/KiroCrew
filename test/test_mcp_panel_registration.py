"""Registration ratchet for the ``kirocrew-panel`` MCP server.

The property this file exists to pin: a default agent pays NOTHING for this
capability. Not a tool-list entry, not a line of context, not a spawned backend.
It is an assignable set that a long-running agent's own spec names, and every
other agent must be unable to tell it exists.

Modelled on ``test_mcp_dashboard_registration.py`` — the same registries have to
agree, and the same silence has to hold for an agent that was never granted the
