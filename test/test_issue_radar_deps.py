"""Tests for Issue Radar's dependency edges + auto-unlock.

Four levels, matching how the six existing signals and the other caches are
tested:

  * the ``deps-cache.json`` store — a stale schema reads as a MISS (so the route
    refetches with the current edge shape rather than serving a graph missing a
    field), and the native-wins dedup that ``_normalize_deps`` owns;
  * ``github_client.fetch_dependency_edges`` — that native and inferred edges are
    both emitted (the store collapses a duplicate pair, native winning), and that
    same-repo scoping drops a cross-repo cross-reference;
  * the ``/deps`` HANDLER — validation, the connected gate, cache-first with the
    TTL, the empty-repo answer, and the GitHub-only guard that gives a non-GitHub
    key an empty graph instead of an error;
  * the SEVENTH sweep signal ``SIG_DEP_UNBLOCKED`` — that it fires exactly ONCE
    when the last blocker closes, stays silent while a blocker remains open, and
    never fires without a real >0 → 0 transition (fingerprint stability).

Every test patches the ``gh`` layer or scopes the store to ``tmp_path``; no
subprocess is spawned and the real data home is never touched.
