"""The artifact store's file helpers ask the sensitive-path fence off the pool.

``ArtifactStore._read_text`` / ``_write_text`` / ``_read_bytes`` / ``_write_bytes``
each canonicalise their path with ``os.path.realpath`` and then ask the fence.
Asking through the bounded ``is_sensitive_path`` costs two ``mc-pathres`` pool
hops per call (the candidate resolution the helper had already performed, plus
the anchor resolution), and ``list()`` reaches ``_read_text`` once per
``meta.json``. On a host with a few hundred artifacts one listing filled the
two-worker FIFO pool from the event loop; the gate then failed closed, the
listing logged every stall as ``refusing to read sensitive path`` and dropped
the artifact, and most of the library vanished from the UI under load.

The fix hands the fence the ``realpath`` the helper already holds, through
``is_sensitive_resolved_path``, whenever the helper runs OFF the event loop:
same decision, same targets, no submission. On the loop the bounded gate stays,
because the pre-resolved gate resolves its anchors inline and an inline
``realpath`` of a wedged root there is the stall the pool's budget prevents. The
dashboard listing handler therefore runs ``store.list()`` on a worker, which is
what earns the listing the off-pool gate. That gate's safety is a PRECONDITION
on its argument that no code enforces, so these tests pin it:

- every helper hands the gate a canonical spelling, and the listing entry point
  does so even when the store is rooted through a directory link;
- the listing submits nothing to the pool and never reaches the bounded gate;
- the two gates agree on canonical fenced and unfenced controls, with the
  literal verdicts spelled out so agreement cannot be vacuous;
- a fenced verdict still refuses every helper, and only the fenced path;
- on the event loop the bounded gate answers, off it the pre-resolved gate does,
  and ``GET /api/artifacts`` runs the listing off the loop.
