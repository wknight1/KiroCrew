"""The gateway's boot prewarm of the speech model, and everything it must not do.

A pointer-down on the microphone is too late to prepare the model: the digest
verification and the native load sit in front of the first utterance's own decode, so
a user who says a short phrase and stops is still waiting on them after they stop
speaking. Measured on a 32-core aarch64 CPU build, first-dictation latency is 1.36 s
without a resident model against 0.66 s with one, and 4.39 s against 2.44 s for
``small``; the saving is the hash plus the load, not the decode, which happens either
way.

Most of these tests are about RESTRAINT rather than about warming. A boot-time task
that runs on every gateway start has more ways to do harm than good: downloading
1.6 GB nobody asked for, stalling the event loop during boot, or taking the gateway
down because a model was absent. Each of those has a test here.
