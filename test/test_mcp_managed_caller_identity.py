"""Pin each managed server's advertised caller-identity to what discovery reads.

The shareability assessment has to answer "can one backend serve two sessions"
for Kiro Crew's own MCP servers WITHOUT spawning them: on a host where the probe
cannot run there is no ``initialize`` response to read the capability from. So
:func:`managed_server_is_session_bound` reads a module constant instead.

That makes the constant a SECOND copy of a fact whose original is the argument
passed to ``run_mcp_stdio_loop`` — and the two disagreeing is silent in both
directions. A constant that says True while the server never advertises would put
an unshareable server in the shareable set; the reverse would keep disqualifying a
server built for pooling, which is the bug this pairing was introduced to fix. So
the ratchet drives the real serve entry point and reads back what it was handed.
