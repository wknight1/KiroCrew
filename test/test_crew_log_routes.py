"""The crew-log read routes and the ``session_projection`` push.

Four things are pinned here that the fold tests cannot see: the owner gate on
the browser's two reads, the one-rule identity gate on the agent's unit-keyed
reads (any session the gateway can NAME may read any unit), the deliberate
difference in posture between a PAGE read and a FOLD read over the same bytes,
and that the push sends a frame only for a projection whose seq actually moved.
