"""Every internal-secret call site into the dashboard must be allowlisted.

Registering a dashboard route and granting it internal access are two separate
manual edits, and nothing couples them. When they disagree the failure only shows
up at runtime: the caller sends ``X-Internal-Secret``, the middleware does not
find the path in either internal allowlist, and the call 403s. Nothing fails at
import, review, or build time. This test is the missing coupling.

Callers reach the dashboard two ways, and BOTH are in scope. Most go through the
``_post``/``_get``/``_put``/``_patch``/``_delete`` helpers in ``mcp_core``, which
attach the secret centrally. A few build their own ``urllib.request.Request`` and
set the header themselves (``mcp_computer``, ``cron_script``, the code-review-sage
driver). The middleware grants any of them only for paths in
``_STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`` or ``_MIXED_INTERNAL_API_PATHS``, matched by
prefix. A path in neither set falls through to ordinary token auth and is
unreachable for that caller. The population is therefore "sends the internal
secret", not "is an MCP module" -- naming it after MCP is what let
``mcp_computer.py`` sit outside an earlier revision of ``_SOURCES``.

EXHAUSTIVENESS IS THE WHOLE POINT, so this file must never quietly skip a call
site it cannot understand. A guard that skips the calls it cannot resolve reads
green while those calls go unchecked, which is worse than no guard because it
manufactures confidence. So every transport call must resolve to an ``/api``
path, and ``test_every_transport_call_resolves_to_a_path`` FAILS on any that does
not, except for the small reviewed set in ``_KNOWN_UNRESOLVED``.

``_SOURCES`` is a hand-listed set, so the same reasoning applies to the list
itself: ``test_no_secret_caller_is_unscanned`` fails if ANY module outside it
reaches the dashboard, by any of the three routes (setting the secret header,
bare-importing a helper, or calling one qualified). Keying that check on the
capability rather than on one call shape is what makes it escape-proof, and it
is why no same-name exemption list is needed: a module with its own private
``_get`` neither imports ``mcp_core`` nor sets the header, so it never matches.

Resolving the path argument therefore has to follow the shapes these modules
really use, not just literals:

* a literal, or an f-string whose interpolations are unknown at rest
* a module-level constant, including one interpolated into an f-string
  (``f"{_api_base()}{COMMAND_PATH}"`` in ``mcp_tools/browser.py``)
* a local variable built earlier in the same function, including one assembled by
  ``+`` concatenation (``"/api/apps/ops-mission-control" + _omc_path``) or
  extended with ``+=``

An unknown span becomes the marker ``{X}``. Where a marker occupies a whole path
segment the path is still CONCRETE and is matched against the allowlists exactly
as the middleware would. Where a marker is glued to the tail of a segment the
runtime path is only known up to that point, so the path is treated as a PREFIX
and the assertion weakens honestly: some allowlist entry must begin with the
literal head. That is what covers the Ops Mission Control family, whose thirteen
endpoints are allowlisted individually and deliberately not by bare prefix.

Scope, and what this deliberately does not check:

* Membership, not bucket choice. It asserts a path is in strict OR mixed, not
  that it is in the RIGHT one. A browser-polled route wrongly placed in strict
  passes here and still hard-denies forwarded browsers at runtime.
* For a PREFIX path it proves the family is granted, not that the specific
  endpoint is. An unallowlisted endpoint added under an already-granted prefix
  would pass here.
* Bucket disjointness already has its own guard in
  ``test_internal_path_bucket_disjointness.py``. This file does not repeat it.
