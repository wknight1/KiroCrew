"""Tests for DashboardState.mutate_folders — the shared serialized folder writer.

The primitive replaced seven bare ``save_folders()`` calls. Two defects motivated
it, and each has a test here:

* an ``fsync`` on the event loop stalls chat and heartbeat processing;
* an unserialized read-modify-write lets two writers each miss the other's
  change, so whichever write lands second silently drops it.
