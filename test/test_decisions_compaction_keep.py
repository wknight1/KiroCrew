"""``compaction.keep`` -- the shadow point that scores an automatic compaction.

Four properties this file pins, because each of them is a way the measurement could
be wrong rather than merely absent:

* the FITTING ladder picks the first stage under the ceiling, and a transcript that
  fits nowhere is recorded rather than sent;
* the redaction runs BEFORE the clip, and no tool RESULT byte is on the wire at any
  stage;
* the questions are batched, every batch carries the SAME state, and a partial
  answer publishes nothing;
* the per-call answers map onto the three options and onto the two character arms.
