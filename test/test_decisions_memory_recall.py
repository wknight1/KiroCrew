"""``memory.recall``: what it keeps, what it sends, and everything it refuses.

The point narrows a list, so most properties here are about the two directions it
must never move in: it may not admit a memory the search did not rank, and every
failure must leave the similarity top-k exactly as it is. The positive claims are
that a keep/drop answer is applied live, that the record names both arms, and that
each snippet is redacted BEFORE it is clipped.

``decide`` is patched at the module the point calls it through, so these drive the
point's own logic rather than the gate's -- the gate has its own suite. The tests
that need the REAL gate (the point name being admitted, the scrub over a snippet)
say so and use it.
