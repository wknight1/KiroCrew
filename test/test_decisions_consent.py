"""The decision-seam consent keystone: the file, its fences, and its one writer.

Consent to send conversation state to Jev is an authorization, so it lives on
``decisions_consent.json`` -- a KEYSTONE leaf the agent can neither read nor
write -- and never in ``config.json``. Three things are pinned here:

* the leaf is fenced on every layer the other keystones are fenced on: the
  agent file-tool gate (``_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``), the sandbox read-only mount,
  and the absent-ceiling pre-create list;
* every read fails soft to NOT CONSENTED and only a literal ``true`` consents --
  and only for the endpoint it was recorded for, because ``provider.endpoint`` is
  in the agent-writable ``config.json`` too;
* the dashboard handler is owner-only on read and write, validates strictly,
  audits, and never clobbers a corrupt file.

:class:`TestCapabilityCeiling` pins the FLEET's switch above the owner's --
``capabilities.decisions`` -- at both of its chokepoints and on the dashboard
config read that hides the card.
