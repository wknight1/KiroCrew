"""Named conditions in the structured engine: the two behaviours layer 3 carries.

A per-entry model earns review only if the two behaviours it exists to carry are
pinned, because they are the two the whole-subject fingerprint could not express:

* an ``IMMEDIATE`` condition bypassing the coalescing floor, and
* a ``NEVER`` condition surviving a head change that resets its siblings.

``test/test_irq_port_baseline.py`` and ``test/test_irq.py`` are the oracle for
both on the cron path, which this change does not touch. These are the same
behaviours asserted in engine terms, so a port that cannot reproduce them has not
moved the behaviour.

Each pinned behaviour is stated with its differential: the assertion that the
same position WITHOUT the claim behaves the other way. Without the differential a
test passes on an engine that bypasses the floor for everything, or one that
never resets anything.

The window rides on ``MonitorState``; a decision reads and updates it and the
caller persists the same state, so no file is held here.
