"""The crew log reference documents types the code actually owns, with valid examples.

An API reference drifts silently: a type is renamed in ``schema.TYPE_OWNERSHIP`` and
the page that documents it keeps its old spelling, or an example is hand-edited into
a shape the envelope would refuse. Both failures look fine to a reader, which is
exactly why they need a gate rather than a review.

Two properties are asserted here.

Every type the page documents is a type this build's session kind owns. Ownership is
per DOMAIN (the part before the slash), matched by prefix so a new action needs no
registry change, so the domain is what can be checked -- and it is the half that
actually moves when the schema is reorganised.

Every JSON example parses, survives the envelope reader, and would be accepted as a
session entry: owned type, acceptable ``src``, serializable ``data``, and a
serialized line inside the size ceiling. The examples are the part of a reference a
reader copies, so an example the writer would refuse is worse than no example.

The page's own summary table is checked against its subsections in the same pass.
The table is the index a reader scans; a type in one and not the other means the page
disagrees with itself.

Scope is the LIVE types only -- the subsection headings. The "Removed types"
appendix names types with no emitter, deliberately kept as a plain table with no
subsection and no example, so trimming them from the schema does not red this test.
