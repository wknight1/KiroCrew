"""Tests for the crew-webview HTTP routes.

The property worth guarding hardest: which crew a publish writes to is derived
from the CALLING SESSION's own crew binding, never from anything the caller
sends. A body-supplied crew name would let one crew publish a webview that
presents as another's, and the whole value of a per-crew dashboard is that the
operator can trust whose state they are reading.
