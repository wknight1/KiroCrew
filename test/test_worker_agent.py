"""The ``kirocrew-worker`` agent spec, and the conductor side of the same server.

Pins the Phase 2 exit criteria about specs: the worker spec is the default agent's
SUPERSET plus ``@kirocrew-work``, and the conductor specs that mount the server
auto-approve the two conductor tools while auto-approving neither worker tool.

Which conductors those are is the other half. ``kirocrew-conductor`` mounts it —
it IS the ledger conductor — and so does its deprecated ``kirocrew-ledger-conductor``
alias, which emits the same spec under the old name for one release.
``kirocrew-pipeline-conductor`` does not: its children report through the
``pipeline-conductor`` skill's own scripts, so the mount would grant a flow whose
procedure it does not run.

    Four enumeration tests below reason over the package, and one traversal serves all of

    worse on the Windows shards, whose job budget is 40 minutes for a quarter of a

    is not part of them.

    The sharing is ``test/source_corpus.py``'s and NOT an ``lru_cache`` of our own,
    because the text of the ~1,550 modules under ``src/`` is ~115 MB of retained ``str``
    and only the corpus helper's copy can be released: ``test/conftest.py``'s
