"""The private-member gate in front of the session-control HTTP routes.

The bug: every ``memory_version: 2`` crew-member DM slot got a blanket 403
``member_scope_denied`` from ALL FIVE session-control routes, because
``_require_internal`` refused any verified V2 caller before the request ever
reached ``session_control.py``. That made the member operating model — a DM
thread dispatching workers it creates and patrols — unreachable, even though
``session_control.py`` already has the full member fence (``_member_bypass``,
``authorize_target``'s ``not_creator``, ``create_session``'s workspace check).

These tests pin the NEW seam, ``_private_caller_refusal``:

* a crew-member DM slot (``member-*`` session key) under ``member_dispatch`` is
  admitted (the gate returns ``None`` and the real handler runs);
* an ordinary chat slot (``chat-*`` session key) whose bound memory store is a
  crew member's V2 store is admitted too — case (b), keyed on the STORE via
  ``_store_is_member_owned`` rather than the session-key prefix;
* every OTHER verified V2 caller keeps the ``member_scope_denied`` refusal — a
  private V2 caller whose store is NOT a crew member's store, and a member while
  the operator ceiling is off;
* an owner / Global-V1 caller (no private scope) falls through as before;
* an unverifiable caller keeps the ``member_session_unverified`` refusal.

The gate keys on ``sc.member_dispatch_enabled()``, the same ceiling
``session_control.py`` reads, so it can never open wider than the switch it
stands in front of. ``internal_memory_scope`` is stubbed here to isolate the
gate's decision from the member-proof plumbing that is exercised elsewhere, and
``_store_is_member_owned`` is stubbed to isolate it from the config record
(that predicate has its own unit tests).
