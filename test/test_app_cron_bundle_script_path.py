"""An app cron's bundle script must resolve against the bundle, not the CWD.

``register_app_crons_with_service`` vetted an app cron's ``script`` through the
generic operator resolver with no app-bundle context. That resolver resolved a
relative path with ``Path(expanduser(part)).resolve()`` -- against the gateway
PROCESS's current working directory -- and then required the result to sit under
``<config_dir>/crons/``. Both halves are wrong for a script an app ships in its
own bundle under ``<config_dir>/apps/<app>/``, so no spelling an app author could
write in a manifest ever passed: a bare filename resolved to the CWD, a
bundle-relative path resolved to a CWD join, and an absolute bundle path tripped
the ``crons/`` containment check. The cron was re-vetted and denied on every
gateway start and every re-registration pass, and the phantom path in the denial
tracked whatever directory the gateway happened to start in.

The fix gives :func:`resolve_script_path` an optional ``app_root``: it becomes
the base a relative spec resolves against and narrows containment to that one
bundle. The bridge passes it and then PERSISTS the resolved absolute spec,
because every later consumer re-resolves ``job.script`` holding no app context.
A bundle root accepts ``.py`` files only -- a bundle also holds ``.app_secret``
(the app's gateway credential) and app data, and the cron script surface is
readable through the dashboard's script-source endpoint.

Containment, link and sensitivity behaviour is unchanged. The bundle roots are
an explicit opt-in on both keywords, so a caller passing neither -- ``cron_add``,
the CLI, both vault-grant sites -- keeps the operator contract byte for byte,
including its refusal of an absolute bundle path.

Must be runnable with ``--noconftest`` (no hypothesis dependency).
