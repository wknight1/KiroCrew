"""One sampled turn, all the way across the seam: decide, show, judge.

Two halves of this feature were built against a contract rather than against each
other: the point publishes an outcome under the session key it was handed, and the
message finalizer claims one under the session key its slot resolves to. Each side
is covered on its own -- ``test_decisions_points.py`` and
``test_decisions_integration.py`` for the decision,
``test_decisions_strip_rides_message.py`` and ``test_decisions_feedback_route.py``
for the ride-along and the verdict. Neither can see the JOIN, and the join is the
one thing a contract cannot prove: a key that does not match yields no strip and
no error, so the whole feature would go quiet without a single test turning red.

So this drives the real chain once, with nothing stubbed between the links: a real
``ContextBuilder.build_message`` on an executor thread (the only way production
reaches it) publishes through the real registry; the real ``_flush_segment``
claims it onto a real slot's assistant row; the real feedback handler files a
verdict against the ``turn_id`` that row carries. Only the provider is a stand-in,
because the one thing this must not do is send anything.
