"""``decide`` / ``is_enabled`` / ``timeout_secs``: the four refusals and the call.

The load-bearing test in this file is
:class:`TestDisabledPerformsNoAwait`: it is the reason this seam is safe to place
in a hot path, and it is asserted by making the implementation fail the test if it
is entered at all, rather than by timing anything.

The second load-bearing group is :class:`TestEnablingIsExplicit`. Consent is the
switch that lets conversation state leave the machine and it lives on the KEYSTONE
``decisions_consent.json``, never in ``config.json`` -- so the tests here pin that
only a literal ``true`` on the keystone opens it, and that nothing an operator or
an agent can write into ``config.json`` (``enabled``, the earlier
``preview``/``points``/``arm`` spelling) stands in for it.

:class:`TestGovernanceWithdrawsTheSeam` pins the layer ABOVE that switch: a fleet
that pins ``capabilities.decisions`` off makes an already-consented keystone inert,
at the one keystone read every path funnels through.
