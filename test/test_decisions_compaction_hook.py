"""The AUTO-compaction hook: it runs, and it changes nothing.

Three claims, and the second and third are the reason the point is allowed on this
path at all:

* both AUTOMATIC entry points reach the shadow scoring, because both funnel through
  ``_compact_session``;
* the compaction is not DELAYED by it -- the task is created and never awaited, so a
  scoring that never finishes cannot hold the compaction;
* the compaction's own OUTCOME is unaltered, arm for arm.

The manual ``/compact`` path is covered by ABSENCE and is asserted as such: the
dashboard dispatches that command through ``provider.stream_command`` and never calls
``_compact_session``, so the assertion is that no manual caller exists.
