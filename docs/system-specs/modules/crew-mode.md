# Crews

A **crew** is a named entry in the config's `agents` map. It binds a kiro-cli
agent template plus a workspace, a memory store, a model and a reasoning effort,
and it carries free-text `triggers` that decide whether the orchestrator may
route work to it. The selection path is the `select_crew` MCP tool.

This spec used to own a second thing spelled *crew*: **Crew Mode**, the
`"crew"` chat-slot mode whose control plane (`crew_chat.py`) fanned one
session's topics out to sub-sessions. It is retired — see
[Retired: Crew Mode](#retired-crew-mode) — in favour of the Crew Members page
(`/members`, served by `dashboard/handlers/members.py` and `members.py` in the
table below), where each crew is a standing agent with its own thread.

A crew is not a *Remote Instance* (see [instances.md](instances.md)), and not
an Issue Radar *crew*, which is that app's own repository work crew
(see [issue-radar.md](issue-radar.md)).

## Components

Legacy topic respawn requires its original run identity or surviving legacy
run state. If pruning removed both, continuation refuses with a named memory
error and leaves the queued request retryable; the owner must start a new topic.
Missing history must never silently turn a private topic into Global memory.

Crew creation reports `409 agent_exists` for both an existing name and a
concurrent name collision. The member-titled form uses its translated duplicate
message only for that status and code together. Other conflicts, including
memory and template-ownership failures, retain the API error message; missing
or malformed codes are not guessed to mean a duplicate. Failed creation leaves
the form open with its entered name and selected template intact.

## Execution-choice catalog

`GET /api/agents/catalog` lists configured members and discovered shared templates
without enrolling, pruning or allocating a member. Each row carries an explicit
`selection_kind` (`member` or `template`); a member and template with the same name
remain separate choices. This projection grants no execution or memory authority.
Member rows retain the existing roster's field allowlist and redaction rules.
Template rows expose only name, kind, scope, provider-template name, description
and source; they do not claim a member memory binding or expose spec paths.

Project discovery uses only the requesting chat's project, selected through
`X-Session-Key`. An unscoped chat or a request without a chat key never borrows
another slot's project. An unknown slot and an app request for a foreign slot
return `404 slot_not_found`. Project templates shadow same-named global templates
according to discovery's existing execution precedence, not member-name precedence.

Private copies and the runtime's own `kirocrew` / `kirocrew-lite` specs (discovery
`source == "kirocrew"`, the same rule the sync route applies) are withheld from
standalone choices; the other shipped specs are ordinary template rows.
Lineage is read strictly in addition to discovery's optional display enrichment:
an unreadable lineage file cannot make a private copy appear shared. Discovery,
config or lineage failure returns `503 agent_catalog_unavailable`, not a partial
success that looks like an empty catalog. Existing member records remain listed
when their template is absent, and querying the catalog leaves their configuration
and memory unchanged. The member-management API (`/api/agents`) and the
synchronization route (`POST /api/agents/sync`) retain their contracts, but the
dashboard pickers no longer call sync: `useAgents` reads the catalog, so opening a
chat, the schedule form or the channel page enrols nothing. The hook returns the
full typed list as `choices` (the chat agent pop-up renders it grouped under
**Crewmates** / **Agent templates**, each member row wearing the same avatar the
roster draws for it, the origin badge dropped because the header already says what
a row is, and the templates group carrying a one-line hint that a template pick
runs the shared template on the shared default memory and enrols nothing) and
the same list folded to one row per name, member first, as `agents` for the
name-only consumers (cron `agent_id`, channel and project bindings, the cycle
shortcuts). A pick sends `agent_kind` with the name on slot create and on
`/api/chat/slots/{slot}/agent`; the slot stores the committed kind, persists it with
the other slot-owned metadata (`SLOT_OWNED_META_KEYS`, so a restart restores a
template pick as a template pick and a later name-only pick retracts it) and the list
projection exposes it, so a same-name member and template are distinct sessions. A
member DM thread's pin covers the namespace too: the same name picked as a template
is refused like any other re-bind (`409 member_thread_agent_pinned`).
Request and error contract: [learn-cron-dashboard](learn-cron-dashboard.md) → Chat.

## Agent templates tab

The Template pane inside a crew editor edits that crew's PRIVATE copy of a
template (blueprint semantics, below). The **Agent templates** tab under Agent
Capabilities is the other half: it manages the shared templates themselves,
the files under `~/.kiro/agents/` a chat or a crewmate runs.

`GET /api/agents/templates` returns every global discovery row with two
additions. `read_only` is `null` for a template the user owns, or names why it
cannot be edited or deleted here: `package` (the package rewrites the file on
its next install), `runtime` (`OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES`, refreshed by the
runtime), `markdown` (a JSON round-trip would lose fields), `private_copy`
(it belongs to one crew's pane, where reset and publish keep its lineage
straight). `used_by` lists what still points at the template — each crew whose
`kiro_agent` resolves it, the default agent, each schedule whose `agent_id`
names it, each chat folder whose `default_agent` pins it (what every new
session filed there starts on), each webhook token whose `agent` pins it (its
calls are refused once the agent is gone), each private copy forked from it —
and is the same list the delete guard evaluates, so the tab shows before a
delete what a refusal would say. The folder pins are snapshotted from the
dashboard's folder store on the event loop (`state.read_folders`) before the
roster is built in the discovery executor. An open chat slot that picked the
template (`agent_kind: "template"`) is deliberately NOT a reference: a slot is
a conversation on screen, not a configuration that redirects future work, and
a guard whose answer depended on which tabs are open in which window could not
be reasoned about from the roster — the decision and its consequence are
stated in the module docstring of `handlers/agent_templates.py`.

The delete guard's reference check and unlink are ONE off-loop critical
section under every lock the reference stores' writers take — the shape
`_unlink_copy_unless_referenced` in `handlers/agents.py` established. The
folder store lock is held across the whole section (`state.hold_folders`, a
snapshot-handing hold that may hop off the loop, added for this), so no folder
pin can commit between the check and the unlink; inside it, the `config.json`
advisory lock and, nested, the `config.local.json` overlay's own lock are held
through `update_config_locked` (writing nothing), which is cross-process — a
CLI `config set` or another gateway is excluded, not just this loop's
handlers — and the EFFECTIVE config (base with the overlay merged) plus the
fork sidecar (whose writers run inside the same config hold) are read under
them; the spec lock wraps the unlink itself. Nothing in the section runs on
the loop. Schedules and webhook tokens are read inside the section but their
writers hold none of these locks; that window is documented in the handler,
not closed. Create applies the same two-layer binding check before writing:
a name bound only in the overlay is refused (`409 name_bound`) like one bound
in the base, and a duplicate re-reads its SOURCE inside the spec lock (the
fork/publish shape) so a save that lands between the pre-lock probe and the
write is what gets copied. A successful create or delete emits its own
operation-labelled SEL line (`agent_templates.create` / `.delete`, outcome
`ok`) beside the middleware's request-level record; the owner gate logs only
denials.

The tab groups rows as Mine / Private copies / From packages / Built-in
(`lib/templateSource.ts`), lets an owned template's description, model,
prompt, tools and auto-approved tools be edited as one draft saved through the
detail PATCH (the definition keys are refused on a read-only spec, `409
template_read_only`; each tool entry is capped at `MAX_TEMPLATE_TOOL_CHARS`),
and edits skills through the same `AgentSkillsEditor` the crew pane uses.
Skills save on their own and are NOT part of the draft: the editor invalidates
the `['agent-templates']` prefix, which the detail query shares, so the editor
reseeds from a refetch only while the draft is clean — a dirty draft is never
overwritten by a background refetch. The read-only rule for a PATCH is decided
from the targeted FILE (its name and declared `name`, classified the way
discovery classifies a row, plus the fork sidecar), never by looking the
declared name up in the deduplicated roster: `atlas.json` beside
`SomePkg-atlas.json` keeps only the package twin there, and a lookup would let
the package file through as if it were the plain one. Resources and MCP
servers are shown read-only: skills are a computed view over `resources`, and
an MCP server is a capability grant with its own admission path. Auto-approval
marks are advisory: the governance sanitizer still withholds an entry the
ceiling may speak to. A read-only template's banner carries the reason once
and **Duplicate to edit** beside it; creating (`POST /api/agents/templates`,
blank or a lineage-free copy of any installed template) refuses a name an
installed spec or a crew binding already resolves, and answers `409
ambiguous_template_name` when two files declare the name. The detail header
holds two controls — **Chat with this template** and an overflow menu (enroll,
duplicate, delete); **Chat with this template** creates a slot with
`agent_kind: "template"` (its title says it is a one-off chat that creates
nothing, or, while the draft is dirty, why it is disabled); **Enroll as
crewmate** is the ordinary `POST /api/agents` with the template as
`kiro_agent`, and its menu row says what it starts (a crewmate with its own
memory, nothing running). The unsaved-changes bar names how many crewmates a
save affects and that saving needs no restart while the page header's **Apply
& Restart** only relaunches sessions already running. A rejected detail read
renders its `ErrorNotice` ahead of the loading state (the draft stays null on a
rejection, so a draft-gated loading branch would mask the error); MCP server
rows render only string-valued `url` / `command` / `type` fields, since a spec
is a hand-editable file. The skills editor carries its own heading, so the tab
adds none over it. Nothing on this tab enrols a member as a side effect. The usage line under the header
names every holder kind the guard counts (crewmates, default agent, schedules,
chat folders, webhooks, private copies), so nothing is first heard of when a
delete is refused; **Create and edit** refetches the roster before selecting
the new row, since the auto-select effect replaces a selection the roster does
not list; the create dialog is titled **Duplicate <name>** when opened from a
Duplicate affordance, so the three duplicate entry points read as one flow.

## Owner-reviewed capability inheritance

`agent_capabilities.py` resolves one verified Parent and explicit per-item
`set`, `remove` and `inherit` intent. The owner-only GET, POST preview and PUT
routes at `/api/agents/{name}/capabilities` use schema version 1. Preview ends
in `/preview`; PUT requires its opaque preview token and the GET revision.
Unknown fields, null sets, stale sources and ambiguous names are refused.

Enrollment is explicit. Shared members follow their selected Parent; a legacy
private snapshot starts with every existing row local and every absent Parent
row removed. Restoring one row leaves all other overrides intact. MCP transport
replacement is whole-value; autoApprove is separate. Skills preserve manual
resources and cannot change tool or approval lists. An exclusion still covered
by a wildcard or another approval list is refused instead of claimed effective.
Ordinary upstream changes reconcile through the same resolver. New capabilities,
transport changes and broader approvals stay pending owner acceptance. Local
conflicts retain their usable values: accepting a Parent row moves only the
accepted Parent baseline, an explicit local override on that row keeps applying
on top of it, and an `inherit` or restore on that row adopts the current
Parent value and advances that row's accepted baseline. Selected Parent rows can be accepted for
several already-enrolled members of the same exact Parent in one request. The
editor offers those members as a checklist drawn from the declared crew roster
(the current member excluded); the backend alone decides eligibility and
answers `member_parent_mismatch` for a member outside this exact Parent. The
checklist hint says only that the names are declared members and that
eligibility is verified at review; it never calls a listed member eligible. The
pane's mode badge names the persisted following mode without a `Saved:` prefix;
the separate Saved/"Unsaved draft" badge reports draft state, using the same
"draft" word as the footer, its confirmation and the stale notice. Ticking
Follow changes the draft, not that persisted mode badge. One muted legend above
the row list, rendered once rather than per row, defines the source select's
three states: Inherited follows the parent's accepted value, Override sets this
member's own value, Removed drops it for this member. A shared-reference row
says it references a shared skill or resource with no private copy; it promises
no propagation to running members. The locked Agent Template pane's navigation
button reads "Edit in Capabilities"; the pane title stays "Capabilities".
The preview lists every member the reviewed request covers, the current
member first, and states "no effective value changes" when the effective values
are unchanged, without implying that inheritance metadata is unchanged. Each
Parent checkbox names its save-time action from the draft's actual Source first,
then the saved row state: Override dismisses the update while keeping the override;
Removed dismisses it while keeping the row removed; Inherited takes the Parent
value or removal. An explicit `inherit` draft already takes the current Parent
and advances its accepted baseline even unchecked, so its checkbox only selects
that update for the chosen peers; a nearby accessible hint separates the current
member's save outcome from the checkbox's peer-only effect in two short lines.
Action labels lead with what is kept or taken.
This replaces the generic acceptance label and duplicated selection/outcome prose.
Parent change-kind badges say "Parent added/removed/changed this", separately from
the impact list's Added/Removed/Changed labels and the conflict badge. The shared
and legacy modes both say "Not following parent", with an independent-legacy-
snapshot qualifier for the latter. The visible `local` state label is
Override; its API value remains `local`. The receipt then
names each kept row under the current member, derived only from the reviewed
selection, the server view's conflict flag and the sanitized preview projection
(a row still `local` and present, or still `removed` and absent, with no impact
entry), and shows Override or Stays removed beside its reference; it
never prints a value, never reads the raw draft, and never invents kept-row
details for a peer member, whose rows the response does not project. An
Inherited row that follows a Parent removal is never labelled as a kept local
choice; it is an impact entry when its effective presence changes.
The Follow checkbox places the unchanged-until-save and value/empty-field
preservation guarantee beside the control; one state-carrying helper explains
checked means overrides are editable and unchecked means read-only, replacing
the duplicate enrollment callout. Both are accessible descriptions while the
checkbox's accessible name stays stable. The label explicitly targets the native
checkbox id, so clicking its text toggles enrollment. Conflict and receipt prose wraps at
word boundaries; long code references can break anywhere. The transport option
is "Command (local process)"; the conflict badge says "Conflicts with your
override", distinct from the Override row state. Reload retrieves the server view
without moving the draft's revision; "Use the new version for this draft" moves
that revision and invalidates a prior preview, but does not review or save.
Review and atomic save remain separate steps. Receipt counts use registered
locale-specific plural forms. The approval helper states that
making a tool available does not auto-approve it. A short live helper under the
list selector states where the selected list is stored and which references it
matches; the select and section labels stay short. Empty approval
section headings are hidden, but their selector choices and draft additions
remain available. Hidden transport leaves keep short placeholders; a separate
hint explains that typing changes only the draft, saved hidden values remain
until a replacement is saved, and discarding keeps the original. The footer's
Discard draft opens a nested, always-mounted Radix confirmation rather than
immediately clearing the draft. Cancelling keeps edits and the signed preview;
confirming clears the draft and preview without closing the editor or calling
the server. The editor's separate close guard states in its title that it closes
the editor, names the member whose edits are unsaved, and says no other member
is affected, since one editor holds one draft.

Each owner save writes new private spec identities and switches all selected
bindings through one config-delta publication. This includes changes to accepted
Parent baselines or local intent whose effective values stay unchanged; only a
save with unchanged spec and intent keeps its generation. Failed spec or config
publication keeps the prior bindings, specs, accepted baselines and local choices;
old generations may be marked pending, but staged choices remain private on new
generations. Reconciliation can clear that pending marker without accepting the
failed batch; the owner can review and retry the same selection. After binding
publication, a failed final receipt leaves all selected new generations pending;
reconciliation verifies them without minting replacements. Preview
values redact credential containers. The existing governance sanitizer still
runs at publication. Withheld shortcuts become tombstones, so a later policy
relaxation does not resurrect them automatically.

`prepare_member_capabilities(member, project_dir)` verifies the saved spec and
Parent identity without claiming that a provider loaded it. API runtime state
remains pending or unverified until runtime integration supplies observations.
The existing fork refresh delegates enrolled definitions to this resolver.
Legacy PATCH and direct rebind refuse an enrolled definition rather than
bypassing its intent. Unreadable authoritative state returns bounded
`503 capabilities_unavailable`; the final PATCH guard runs under the spec lock
before bookkeeping. A late legacy publish rebind refusal retains the old binding
and rolls back its staged destination, not a claim that no writes occurred.
Runtime views are projected from allocation-owned state through the public
`SessionManager.capability_runtime_view` facade; response rows expose no mutable
registry dictionaries. The existing whole-reset button explicitly restores the
verified current Parent through the capability transaction. Publish flattens
only the saved valid snapshot, without accepting pending Parent expansions or
exporting inheritance metadata. Publish records its member, source and target
snapshot identities in the existing sidecar before creating the destination or
committing the binding. The destination stays private until a second
config-first transaction verifies its binding, ownership, bytes and current
governance and clears only the temporary lineage. A failed final write returns
the committed template with `warning: publish_incomplete`, matching legacy
publish behavior. Retrying the same name completes that transition, including
after restart or a lost response; changed source/target bytes, a newer binding
or foreign ownership refuse without overwriting anything. Completed receipts
remain for idempotent retries and never enter the shared agent JSON.

Native permission policies that exactly match
the existing allowedTools derivation follow owner approval edits. Custom
permission policies and alternate toolsSettings shortcuts require a separate
review and are refused rather than silently bypassed. Cleanup of superseded
private generations is not implemented by this backend checkpoint, and no
generation is deleted today. A future cleanup must retain every generation that
a member binding names, that a live session's `LoadedCapabilities` stamp names,
that a `CapabilityPreparation` returned by `prepare_runtime` still references
between preparation and the loaded stamp, that a persisted resume record could
lead back to, or that a retained publish receipt names as source or target.
Because a preparation exists before any stamp and holds no registry entry, the
three visible references (binding, stamp, receipt) do not prove a generation
unreferenced. Deletion therefore requires a shared lock or explicit allocation
lease taken by the reconciliation seam that mints generations, plus an audit of
persisted resume references, and it fails closed: a generation whose absence of
references cannot be proven is kept. Binding
updates preserve config.local member overrides and write a narrow delta in the
active layer under base-then-overlay locks. A batch spanning both layers uses
one atomic overlay delta. Enrollment preserves absent fields, null prompt/model
values, custom hooks/settings and the original includeMcpJson choice. Removing
capabilities while provider-global MCP inclusion remains enabled is refused as
unrepresentable; enrollment alone never silently disables that existing source.

Parent selection reuses `agent_spec_path` with an explicit scope directory.
Unrelated malformed files are skipped; duplicate names, a broken exact-name
project claim and a changed pinned source still refuse resolution. Safe response
projection retains arrays and maps and masks credential values. URL userinfo
is masked from parsed username or password on every scheme, without relying on
the shared redactor's known-scheme patterns; revision-bound URL retention still
preserves the exact original bytes. Complete sensitive
`NAME=VALUE` argument assignments are recognized on both sides of `--`; that
terminator stops option inference, not assignment scanning. Retention preserves
the entire original argument, including additional equals signs in its value. The
`agent_capabilities.py` response boundary is registered in the security posture
redaction inventory, so the omission gate checks it with the other outputs. MCP `set`
accepts `retain_paths`, RFC6901 pointers into the complete replacement value.
Each pointer must address exactly `[REDACTED]` and the same redacted scalar leaf
in the current member transport. Empty/root, malformed, overlapping, duplicate
and out-of-range pointers refuse the whole request; any unretained placeholder
also refuses. Omitted fields are removed, not deep-merged. Retained bytes stay
server-side and are covered by preview/revision checks. MCP rows carry an
explicit `managed` flag; absent prompt/model rows remain editable. Rows do not
carry constant `editable` or redundant `locked_reason` fields: managed transport
fields stay read-only while Source and Enabled remain available. Runtime status
is one of pending, unverified, applied or failed; the separate Saved configuration
badge describes persisted configuration, not provider application.

Owned Parents retain the existing dynamic command, hooks and data-home refresh.
That pass cannot add omitted servers or tools and preserves local prompt/model
and resource choices. App namespace transports require a current enabled app's
exact declaration and use its authoritative transport. Safe ordinary Parent
fields (description, welcomeMessage and keyboardShortcut) follow updates; legacy
snapshots retain their explicit local baseline for these fields.

Reconciliation publishes changed bytes under a new private name and atomically
switches the member binding, leaving the old runtime's file unchanged. A no-op
keeps its generation. Failed writes retain pending intent; retry completes it
without modifying an earlier generation. Already-published pending receipts can
finish without another generation. Public revisions are random version ids;
source-content digests remain internal. The prepare seam refuses pending work
and never reports provider application from a successful save. Enrollment
intent lives in the shared `agent_model_state.json`, so an unreadable sidecar
cannot prove any declared member unenrolled: `prepare_runtime` refuses every
crew-member cold start with the closed code `capability_state_unreadable` (the
capabilities API answers `503 capabilities_unavailable`) rather than inferring
legacy mode, and a session that resolves to no crew never reads the sidecar.
An explicit `crew_agent` claim naming no `config.agents` entry refuses with
`capability_member_missing`; an implicit name outside the crew namespace
resolves to no crew and is unaffected.

## Crew records and binding

A crew lives only in `config.json` under `agents.<name>`. It is not a kiro-cli
agent file: `kiro_agent` points at one. `resolve_agent_bindings` turns a crew
name into `ResolvedBindings`, in this order:

1. the named crew, when it is a key of `config.agents`;
2. otherwise a **materialized** kiro agent of that name (an app-registered agent
   under the user's `~/.kiro/agents/`, or a project agent), which keeps
   dispatching itself with the default workspace and Global Memory V1;
3. otherwise `default_agent`, with `requested_resolved` set to `False` so a
   caller never advertises a binding that is not running.

An unresolvable workspace falls back to `default_workspace`. Memory identity
resolves exactly: the reserved `default` assistant uses Global Memory V1;
existing V1 members keep their declared V1 binding.
Explicitly created members own unique V2 stores identified by an immutable persisted `member_id`, independent of their editable label.
Automatically discovered agents start on Global V1 without member allocation.
Missing, unreadable, shared or mismatched member identity makes memory operations
unavailable without choosing Global. Rules and briefing remain usable without
the learned database. Member isolation is routing for built-in tools, not secrecy
against arbitrary code running as the same OS user.
Selecting a member as `default_agent` preserves that member's memory version and
binding. With no agents configured, the resolver returns the existing defaults.

Member creation automatically provisions empty member memory. Members cannot
choose a shared store or rebind their member store. Legacy members may continue
using V1; member updates never initialize a V2 database. Global and named V1
contents remain untouched. Config fields, exclusive database creation, immutable database identity and
recovery semantics are owned by [config](config.md#named-memory-stores-memory_storespy).

A new member DM inherits the member's configured workspace, falling back to
`default_workspace` when that name is undeclared. Its project directory uses the
shared `default_project_dir` validation, so provider cwd and project essentials
refer to the same workspace. Resolution finishes before publishing the slot;
the first slot broadcast includes its project directory. A concurrent opener's
existing slot is preserved. Reopening a live or restored
thread keeps its saved workspace and project, including an explicitly empty
project, rather than resetting a session choice to the member default.

A newly created V2 member starts a fresh conversation. Existing V1 conversation
and native provider context cannot acquire member memory by changing a label.
The session execution record binds its member ID and store ID across later opens
and restarts. Old schedules and child runs retain their captured member/store.
A provider-side template switch changes persona behavior without selecting a
new memory owner. Ordinary owner/app, capability, native-history and governance
checks still apply to selection changes; see [session](session.md#agent-selection-provenance).

The member side panel's Crew summary tab and the editor link to
`/settings/overview?view=memory&store=<name>`. The member memory workspace has
Memories, Profile and Recovery tabs: browsing/search/correction/copy stay in
Memories, preferences and project anchors stay in Profile, and backups plus
retired experiences stay in Recovery. Advanced facet analysis is collapsed.
Profile and Recovery load on first visit; visited Profile stays mounted so tab
changes cannot discard its drafts. Changing the selected member requires explicit
discard while a profile draft or memory mutation dialog is open. Source references
are rendered as origin labels and item references rather than JSON payloads.

The workspace header, store picker and copy-source picker reuse the owning
member's exact avatar descriptor and name, including uploaded pictures. Returning
from the member editor refreshes that identity. Empty memory can open
`/members?member=<exact-name>` directly; this link selects the member by name,
then uses the existing verified thread-opening endpoint. A failed thread open
retains its localized error heading and structured diagnostic report. Details
reveals the redacted reason on demand; Ask the agent receives the same report
when navigation permits. The cached conversation and its drafts remain available.

Reopening a running Member DM, including a turn awaiting tool approval,
reuses its captured execution record. The canonical session key, selected
member, live slot store and execution record must agree. This read does
not pin or repair memory while work is active; missing, mismatched or unreadable
identity still refuses. The handler rechecks slot identity after the off-loop
store read, and a link to another session remains a conflict.

The member's presence indicator includes active child runs even while its own
turn is idle. Completion of the member's planning turn does not imply its
delegated work has finished. When only child runs are active, the Crew summary
status says "Delegated work running". Driving sessions still lists dashboard
sessions created by the member; child runs do not become dashboard sessions.

Facts, rules and experiences all support correction and explicit forgetting.
Experience correction keeps the same record identity and provenance. A store
marked unavailable still makes a scoped read to obtain its actual refusal, with
Retry and Recovery actions; it never displays cached records as a successful
read. Recovery paginates retired memories and refreshes live recall after an
item is restored. Complete snapshot restoration stays visibly staged across
page visits until gateway restart, and the owner can cancel the pending stage
without changing current memory or its saved backup.

Inline schedules created inside the editor persist `member_id` separately from
the provider template. A legacy schedule carrying only `agent_id` stays in Global
Memory V1 even when that string matches a member alias. The editor lists private
member jobs by exact `member_id`, and an existing job's member is immutable.
Legacy jobs retain their previous template/sequence display attribution and show
Global Memory V1 in the member's Schedules pane. Displaying an old schedule there
does not migrate it or grant access to that member's member store.

`resolve_effective_model` is the single source of truth for what model a new
session on a crew starts with, highest tier first: the crew's own `model`, the
bound kiro agent's pinned model (skipped for the built-in `kirocrew` agent), the
global `agent.model`, then the installed agent file's model. A per-session pick
outranks all four and is not considered there.

The loader is defensive about hand-edited config: a non-string `model` or
`triggers` collapses to `""`, an unknown `reasoning_effort` collapses to inherit,
and a junk watchdog override collapses to `0`.

## Selection: the `select_crew` contract

Discovery importing a provider template as a configured member does not rebind
an existing dashboard conversation that selected the template. Resolved bindings
carry a positive `selection_kind`; the canonical session execution record preserves
that namespace across callbacks and restore. New member conversations still
capture the member ID and store without opening the learned database. An explicit owner agent choice
may replace selection provenance, but cannot migrate an existing V1 native
conversation into member memory. The persistence and legacy-session rules are
owned by [session](session.md#agent-selection-provenance).

`select_crew` has two modes, both answered as JSON by `_do_select_crew`.

`route_crew` resolves each trigger-matched member independently. Healthy matches
retain their rank and owned store. Matching members whose memory cannot be
resolved appear in `unavailable` with a bounded, path- and credential-redacted
reason. No healthy match and no trigger match are distinct outcomes; unavailable
memory never authorizes substitution with Global memory. A named `select_crew`
refusal returns `crew` and `error` without a bound store or routing activity.

**Roster** (`crew` omitted or empty):

```json
{"default_agent": "default",
 "crews": [{"name": "oncall", "triggers": "incident, prod outage"}],
 "guidance": "Select a crew ONLY when its triggers clearly and specifically match…"}
```

Three rules define that list, and each is load-bearing:

- A crew whose `triggers` is empty or whitespace is **omitted entirely**. There
  is no fallback to `description`: no triggers means not a routing candidate.
- `default_agent` is omitted, because it is the caller.
- The response carries `default_agent` and `guidance` so the model has an
  explicit fallback and a high-confidence bar rather than inferring one.

**Bind** (`crew` names a roster entry):

```json
{"crew": "oncall",
 "bound": {"kiro_agent": "oncall-agent", "workspace": "/…/oncall",
           "memory_store": "oncall-mem", "model": ""}}
```

An unknown name answers `{"error": "unknown crew '…'", "available": "…"}`. The
membership test against `cfg.agents` is the deny-by-default gate;
`SELECT_CREW_SCHEMA` deliberately does not impose a name grammar, because crew
creation only strips the name, so a stricter schema would list a crew in the
roster and then refuse to bind it.

A bind also records a routing-decision pointer through
`members.record_activity` with `via="select_crew"`. Two properties of that write
matter:

- The entry keys the session under `decided_in`, not `session`, because the
  decision is made in the parent session while the crew runs somewhere else. A
  consumer counting sessions a crew took part in therefore cannot miscount a
  session the crew never ran in.
- The caller's memory mode is resolved at the call, and only `persistent`
  sessions are recorded. An unreadable session degrades to the private spelling,
  so the failure mode is a missing entry, never a durably logged private session
  key.

These entries are **intent, not execution**: binding a crew does not oblige the
model to delegate to it, and no `via="spawn"` execution entry exists today.

## Delegating to a bound crew

Explicit member delegation uses `spawn_run(crew=<member>)`. The member alias
resolves its provider template and member memory together. The separate
`agent=` argument identifies a provider template, not a durable member identity;
it must not be used to infer access to a member's memory.
The model-facing `spawn_run` schema advertises `crew` separately from `agent`,
so a caller can select a member through tool discovery. A batch's `crew` applies
to every task; delegating to different members requires separate calls.

An ordinary member sub-task inherits its captured member/store. An explicit
existing target member selects that member's store under ordinary spawn,
owner/app and governance permissions. Memory ownership itself adds no separate
cross-member ACL. Continuations retain the original run's member/store even if
a different member now requests the continuation. The gateway still requires
ordinary authenticated session identity before accepting a parent session.

A named-but-unknown agent is **refused**, never silently answered by the default
agent, with the machine-readable code `agent_not_found`. That refusal is a
privilege boundary: the default agent frequently runs at broader approval, so a
typo'd or injected name falling back to it would be an escalation at the manager
primitive. An empty `agent` still means "use the default".

Crew Mode resolves the alias itself instead of relying on the coincidence:
`CrewOrchestrator._dispatch_agent` calls `resolve_agent_bindings` per dispatch
and passes `bindings.kiro_agent`. It returns the raw crew name when
`requested_resolved` is `False`, so an unknown crew is refused by
`_validate_agent` rather than quietly running the default agent under a stale
name, and it resolves an empty crew too so the concrete template stays inside
`capabilities.spawn.scopes.agents`.

## Boundaries

- A crew's `triggers` is free text read by a model. It is not a matcher, and no
  regex interprets it.
- `POST /api/agents` requires an explicit `kiro_agent`; the silent `"kirocrew"`
  default is refused, because it made every template-less crew an alias for the
  default agent. A template absent from the installed listing is accepted with a
  warning rather than refused, since an edition may resolve a row the listing
  cannot see.
- A credential-shaped crew name is refused at creation, and roster values are
  masked for every caller but the owner. An already-stored name is not renamed
  retroactively, which is why the owner keeps reading it verbatim: a name must
  be legible to be renamed.
- `kirocrew`, `kirocrew-conductor`, `kirocrew-pipeline-conductor` and
  `kirocrew-security-conductor` are in `UNADVERTISED_AGENTS`, so they never
  appear in a rendered roster.

## Retired: Crew Mode

Crew Mode was the `"crew"` chat-slot mode: one session whose messages became
durable queue entries, a single-flight decision agent that routed each to a
topic, and one continuable sub-session per topic, with results forwarded back
under `↩ re:` attribution. Its control plane lived in `crew_chat.py`; its
design of record is
[`../../request-for-change/rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md`](../../request-for-change/rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md).

It retired in favour of the Crew Members page, which inverts the model: instead
of one nameless session fanning out to topics, each crew is a named member with
its own standing thread. What remains, and why:

- **No ingress.** `"crew"` is in neither `_CREATABLE_MODES` (`chat_handlers`)
  nor `_VALID_MODES` (`chat_folders`) nor the fork override allowlist, so a
  session can no longer be born or switched into it. A caller still sending
  `mode: "crew"` on auto-create gets a plain slot (the value is dropped like any
  unknown mode); on the create and switch endpoints it is `invalid_mode`.
- **Existing sessions come back as plain chat.** `chat_persistence._restored_mode`
  maps a persisted `mode: "crew"` to `""` on both restore paths. The transcript
  is untouched and still renders; nothing is migrated and nothing is deleted.
  The store the mode kept under `<data home>/crew/<folded key>-<digest>/`
  (`queue.json`, `topics.json`, `forwards.json`, `slot_key`) held only routing
  state — it is neither read nor removed, and a reader who wants the disk back
  may delete that directory by hand.
- **Old transcripts keep their shape.** The frontend's `TurnBlock.isCrewReply`
  still honours the persisted `meta.crew_reply` marker so a forwarded topic
  answer in an old session renders outside the collapse pane, as it did when it
  was written. Nothing writes the marker any more.
- **The autonudge crew/member boundary keeps its vocabulary.** `autonudge_authz`
  still lists `"crew"` beside `"member"` in the modes that refuse an outside
  arm. With no slot able to carry the mode the entry is unreachable, and it is
  left in place rather than re-litigating a security boundary in a removal PR.

The sidebar's create-menu entry that used to create a crew-mode session is now
a "Crew Members" door: it opens `/members` when `PREVIEW_CREW` (Settings →
Developer → Feature Previews) is on and lands on that flag's card when it is
off.
