# Instances Module (multi-instance management over SSH tunnels)

Lets a single Kiro Crew gateway (the **hub**) manage and switch between several
**remote** Kiro Crew instances (dev hosts, EC2, home servers) over SSH **or AWS
SSM Session Manager** tunnels, embedding each remote dashboard as an iframe pane
below a switcher strip. Opt-in: off by default (`instances.enabled`). The transport is
per-instance (`connection_method`) — see §13.

> **Naming — "Remote Instances".** The user-facing surfaces label this feature
> **Remote Instances**: the Settings section (*Settings → Remote Instances*), the
> top-header switcher group ("Remote Instances" / "Switch instance"), and the
> keyboard shortcuts. This is deliberately distinct from the product name
> **Kiro Crew** and from an agent **crew** (an assistant with its own
> workspace/memory — `kiroCrewAgentsPage`, the Crew Members page). Earlier UI copy called
> this feature "Remote Crew"; that wording was retired in favour of "instance" to
> match the code and config it already sits on (`/api/instances`,
> `instances.json`, `InstancesPanel`, EC2 `instance_id` / `ssm_target`). Only the
> **displayed strings** changed — i18n key names and internal identifiers
> (including the `remoteCrewPanel` component/key namespace) are unchanged, so
> "crew" as a shorthand for an instance still appears in code and in this spec's
> prose below.

> **Section numbers in this document are an API.** `src/kiro_crew/cloud/connect.py`
> cites "instances.md §9" from two docstrings (the module docstring and
> `ssm_proxy_ssh_host`). Do not renumber existing sections; append new material as
> new trailing sections.

Code: `src/kiro_crew/instances/` (registry, tunnel manager, port allocator, token
mint, diagnostics, injection validation, run-marker) plus
`src/kiro_crew/dashboard/handlers_instances.py` (control plane) and the frontend
`InstanceTabBar` / `InstancesViewport` / `Settings → Remote Instances` surfaces.

## 1. Overview

A Kiro Crew gateway normally binds the dashboard to loopback only. The Instances
feature lets the hub reach *other* gateways running on remote hosts by opening an
SSH `-L` forward to each remote's loopback dashboard port, minting a short-lived
dashboard token on the remote, and embedding the remote dashboard in an
`<iframe>`. You switch panes from a dropdown (`InstanceTabBar`, plus
Cmd/Ctrl+digit in the Electron shell); the hub keeps the most-recently-used set
"warm" (tunnel + iframe live) and lazily reconnects the rest. The switcher is a
menu rather than a row of chips by DEFAULT because the number of configured crews
is unbounded: the closed trigger costs constant width, and unread counts stay
visible on it as an aggregate badge over every crew that is not on screen. A user
who switches between the same two or three crews can PIN those out of the menu
into always-visible chips beside it, spending header width only on the
destinations they actually use — see [Pinned crew chips](#pinned-crew-chips).

**Key properties**

- **Opt-in.** Nothing changes until `instances.enabled=true`, and the flag is
  read at gateway startup, so it also needs a restart.
- **Owner-only.** The control plane is never reachable via Slack and requires an
  authenticated dashboard session.
- **Loopback-only.** Tunnels forward `127.0.0.1:<local>` to remote
  `127.0.0.1:<remote>`.
- **Warm, not persistent.** Tokens are short-lived (20h cap) and re-minted
  before they lapse; iframes are evicted past the warm cap.

---

## 2. Enabling the feature

```bash
kirocrew config set instances.enabled true
kirocrew restart
```

Settings → Remote Instances offers the same toggle (it PATCHes
`instances.enabled` through `/api/config/kirocrew`) and then shows a
"restart required" hint, because the flag is only consulted in the gateway's
`on_startup` hook.

When enabled at startup, the gateway:

1. creates the instances registry + `SshTunnelManager` and auto-reconnects every
   instance whose `was_connected` hint is set, and
2. extends the dashboard CSP `frame-src` with `http://*.localhost:*` so an
   embedded remote dashboard on a `*.localhost` host can render.

Loopback origins (`http://127.0.0.1:*`, `http://localhost:*`, plus the https and
`0.0.0.0` forms) are in `frame-src` **unconditionally** because the Web Preview
panel needs them; only the `*.localhost` wildcard is instances-gated.

With the flag off, `/api/instances/*` returns `403` and the panel shows an
opt-in card. `GET /api/instances` also reports `active`, which is true only when
the SSH manager actually exists: `enabled && !active` means the flag was set
after startup and a restart is still pending.

```

Module responsibilities:

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `registry.py` | Persistent list of configured instances (`~/.kiro/crew/instances.json`) + `last_active_id`. Light charset check on `ssh_host`/`remote_bin` (SSH) or `ssm_target`/`aws_profile`/`aws_region`/`ssm_run_as` (SSM) at add/update, per `connection_method`; every mutation re-reads the file and writes atomically, so a live gateway and a CLI edit cannot clobber each other. |
| `port_allocator.py` | Probes for a free loopback port at or above `tunnel_base_port` (7778). A port counts as free only when it is free on **every** loopback address (`127.0.0.1` and `::1`), since the forward binds one family and a foreign listener on the other leaves `localhost:<port>` ambiguous; an address the host cannot assign at all (`EADDRNOTAVAIL`/`EAFNOSUPPORT`/`EPROTONOSUPPORT`, e.g. IPv6 disabled) reads as free rather than occupied, while a probe that could not be *run* (`EMFILE` and friends) propagates rather than being coerced to either answer. A single-address primitive (`_is_addr_free(port, host)`) answers the narrower "did *this* forward's own address come free" question that orphan reclaim asks. The probe sets `SO_REUSEADDR` so a `TIME_WAIT` remnant from a just-closed forward is not a false "in use". |
| `token_mint.py` | Runs `kirocrew token --ttl --port --embed-parent-port` on the remote over SSH (run-marker first, then a bin-candidate ladder) and parses the JWT out of the printed URL. Token is returned in memory only, **never logged**. |
| `ssm_token_mint.py` | The SSM sibling of `token_mint.py`: runs the same subcommand via `aws ssm send-command` through the launcher's `cloud.ssm` chokepoint, reusing the shared remote-command builders. Token in memory only, **never logged**. See §13. |
| `validation.py` | The authoritative injection-safe guard on `ssh_host` / `remote_bin`, and on `ssm_target` / `aws_profile` / `aws_region` / `ssm_run_as`, applied immediately before any command line is built. See §11. |
| `run_marker.py` | Records the running gateway's own `kirocrew` launcher (and pid) keyed by port, so a remote mint execs the same venv the live gateway runs from. Also backs zero-config client port discovery. See §12. |
| `ssh_tunnel_manager.py` | Supervises one tunnel child per instance — `ssh -N -L` or `aws ssm start-session` — with readiness wait, health probe, 2-tier self-heal, proactive token refresh, stored-token liveness probe, remote restart. One state machine, two transports. |
| `diagnostics.py` | Dependency-ordered failure probes; reports the first broken link. `diagnose_instance` (SSH ladder) and `diagnose_instance_ssm` (SSM ladder). |
| `handlers_instances.py` | Owner-only, enabled-gated, SEL-audited HTTP control plane. |

**The local forward port is allocated, not mirrored.** `connect()` takes a free
loopback port from `PortAllocator` (from `tunnel_base_port`, skipping ports the
registry has already handed out) and does not require it to equal
`inst.remote_port`. The embedded iframe loads from `http://<host>:<local_port>`
and the remote gateway accepts that on any port because `check_origin` trusts a
loopback `Origin` that equals the request's own `Host` — exactly the shape the
iframe produces — `build_allowed_hosts` compares hostname only, and the session
cookie is keyed off the browser-facing port (`_cookie_port_from_host`), so
distinct local ports get distinct cookies in the shared `127.0.0.1` jar. This
does not weaken CSE SEC-016: a malicious local page on an arbitrary port sends
its own `Origin` while `Host` stays the gateway's, so the two differ and the
request is rejected; browsers forbid scripts from forging either header.

Earlier revisions mirrored the port (`local_port = inst.remote_port`) for the
Origin reason above, which imposed a hard constraint that every
simultaneously-connected instance use a distinct remote port. The shipped
defaults contradicted it — a stock gateway binds the same default port on both
ends, so a stock hub already held the port a stock remote reported and two stock
installs could never connect (#1972). Reconnects reuse the instance's own
previous port so the iframe origin and its cookie stay stable — with one
deliberate exception: a **rebuild** (`connect?rebuild=1`, §4 step 1) excludes the
port it just freed from the allocation, so the rebuilt forwarder lands on a
different port. Rebuild exists to escape a tunnel that passes every probe yet
never finishes serving one stream, and the field evidence for that stall is
port-correlated (every case so far sat on the first allocated port), so a new
origin is the point rather than a cost; the pane's Retry reloads at the new
origin and mints its own port-scoped cookie.

**Platform note.** The hub side of this feature assumes a POSIX host with an
OpenSSH `ssh` client on `PATH`, and run-marker port discovery refuses outright on
non-POSIX (§12). Treat a Windows hub as unverified.

---

## 4. The connect → warm → self-heal lifecycle

1. **Connect.** `POST /api/instances/{id}/connect` validates the ssh inputs,
   allocates a free local forward port, starts
   `ssh -N -L`, waits until the local forward accepts a TCP connection, mints a
   dashboard token on the remote over SSH, and returns the live status plus the
   token. Connect is **idempotent**: an already-connected instance returns its
   current status, and the handler then *probes* the stored token before handing
   it over (see below). Two opt-in query flags bend that in opposite directions,
   and they are mutually exclusive (`400` together):
   - `?rebuild=1` — the pane's Retry after a load watchdog fired on a document
     that DID navigate. Every probe says the tunnel is healthy, so the idempotent
     connect would hand back the same forwarder and the pane would reload into
     the same stalled stream. Rebuild tears the CONNECTED tunnel down under the
     manager lock with `keep_intent=True`, then runs the normal connect with the
     freed port excluded from allocation (§3). A teardown whose stop raises is
     returned as an ERROR status / `502`, the old tunnel left intact and tracked.
     Audited as `connect/rebuild`. One consumer: `InstancesViewport`'s Retry.
     **Provisional.** The recovery rests on a hypothesis — that a fresh
     forwarder on a new port clears the stalled stream — which the
     `[pane-assets]` journal exists to confirm or refute. Until a field
     `STALLED → retry rebuild=true → ready` trace is on record the flag is not a
     stability commitment: if the trace shows the stall recur on the new port,
     the flag, the §3 port exclusion and the mutual-exclusion `400` are removed
     together rather than kept as API.
   - `?only_if_connected=1` — the viewport's auto-warm. Answers a CONNECTED
     tunnel exactly like a plain connect but, for a tunnel that is not up, spawns
     nothing, mints nothing and leaves `was_connected` untouched: `200` with
     `state=disconnected`, `code=instance_not_connected`, audited
     `connect/declined`. Decided under the same lock `disconnect` holds, so an
     auto-warm racing an explicit disconnect can never re-open the tunnel the
     user just closed. Auto-warm pre-mounts panes for tunnels that are already
     up; bringing one up is the fan-out's and the click's job.

   The browser loads
   `http://<dashboard-hostname>:<local>/?token=...` in an iframe, deliberately
   reusing the parent's own hostname so the pane is same-site with the parent and
   `SameSite=Lax` auth cookies are not withheld.
2. **Warm set.** Up to `warm_set_cap` most-recently-used instances
   stay warm: iframe mounted (hide-not-unmount, so switching never reloads or
   re-runs the token handshake) with a live tunnel and WebSocket. The default
   (`0`) is **automatic**: `GET /api/instances` resolves the cap from how many
   crews are REGISTERED (`resolve_warm_set_cap`, bounded by
   `WARM_SET_CAP_AUTO_CEILING`), so up to that ceiling no crew the operator
   configured is evicted; an explicit integer is served verbatim, including one
   below the registered count. Registered rather than connected because a live
   count races tunnel startup: a crew whose tunnel came up a moment after the
   dashboard polled fell outside the cap and lost its pane, so exactly one crew
   looked broken and which one changed on every restart. Exceeding the
   cap **evicts the least-recently-used non-active iframe**. Eviction unmounts
   the iframe only: it does NOT disconnect the tunnel or clear `was_connected`,
   so the switcher entry persists and re-warms on the next click. Entries
   disappear only on an explicit disconnect. Note that re-warming re-mints the
   token and cold-boots the remote SPA, so from the user's seat an eviction is
   hard to tell apart from a dropped connection — which is why the default
   tracks the registry rather than a fixed number.
3. **Health probe.** While CONNECTED, a per-tunnel loop polls the loopback
   forward every `DEFAULT_PROBE_INTERVAL_SECS` (30s, not user-configurable;
   `<= 0` disables the probe); after `probe_failure_threshold` (3) *consecutive*
   failures the child is terminated so recovery fires. This is what catches a
   tunnel that is alive but no longer forwarding.
4. **2-tier self-heal.** On unexpected child exit: **Tier 1** rebuilds the tunnel
   reusing the existing token; **Tier 2** re-mints the token over SSH and then
   rebuilds. Capped at `max_recovery_attempts` (8) consecutive attempts with a
   capped-exponential backoff (`recover_backoff_max_secs`, 30s; the wait grows
   1, 2, 4, 8, 16 then holds at the cap), which spans roughly a two-minute
   window: long enough to outlast a transient drop (screen lock, proxy warmup).
   The counter resets on a successful rebuild or a successful `connect()`. A
   successful rebuild records the replacement child's `local_port` alongside its
   `forwarder_pid` / `forwarder_start` / `forwarder_sig` in one write — the same
   field set `connect()` persists. A rebuild takes its port from the live
   tunnel, and `forwarder_sig` is a MAC over that port, so the port travels with
   the identity that signs it; recording one without the other points both the
   pane URL and the reclaim's signature check at a port the recorded child is
   not bound to. If it
   gives up, the diagnosis ladder runs automatically. The slow SSH I/O runs
   *without* the manager lock so self-heal cannot stall a concurrent
   connect/disconnect/shutdown.
5. **Proactive token refresh.** A per-instance loop re-mints the token at
   `DEFAULT_TOKEN_REFRESH_FRACTION` (0.8) of its TTL, ahead of the 20h cap. The
   frontend mirrors the same 0.8 threshold from `token_ttl_remaining` and skips
   the *active* pane, so a reload never interrupts the pane in use.
6. **Stored-token liveness probe.** A token can go stale while the tunnel stays
   CONNECTED (a failed self-heal re-mint, or a remote `kirocrew restart` that
   invalidates tokens). An iframe loaded with a stale token gets a
   server-rendered 403, so the SPA never boots to fire the reactive
   `mc-auth-expired` recovery. `connect` therefore probes
   `GET /api/status?token=...` over the *existing* forward (no SSH,
   `DEFAULT_TOKEN_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECS` = 2s) and is deny-by-default: anything
   short of a 2xx forces a fresh mint, and if that mint also fails the response
   is a clean 502 rather than a token the gateway cannot stand behind.
7. **Diagnose / restart.** `?diagnose=1` runs the probe ladder on demand;
   `POST .../restart` runs `kirocrew restart` on the **remote** over SSH
   (itself service-aware), after which the local probe detects the bounce and
   self-heals.

**Startup revive.** When the feature is on, the startup hook reconnects every
instance with `was_connected` set, serially (so they do not race to bind their
mirrored ports) and each wrapped, so one unreachable host neither aborts the rest
nor crashes startup. It runs as a background task rather than awaited, because
`on_startup` fires *before* the HTTP port is bound and serial SSH connects would
delay the bind past the desktop app's gateway-wait window. A failed revive leaves
`was_connected` true and records the failure reason, so the entry persists showing
why it is down.

## 5. Configuration

### 5.1 `instances.*` config keys

Transport defaults and bounds live in `kiro_crew.instances.constants` and are
referenced from `InstancesConfig`, so the documented values and runtime policy
cannot drift.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `instances.enabled` | `false` | Primary opt-in, read at gateway startup. Also gates the CSP `frame-src` `*.localhost` extension. |
| `instances.warm_set_cap` | `0` (automatic) | Max instances kept warm at once (bounds memory/sockets; each warm instance is a full dashboard SPA). `0` tracks how many crews are registered, so up to the internal ceiling no configured crew is evicted; an explicit value is honoured exactly, including one below the registered count. Negative values fall back to automatic. |
| `instances.tunnel_base_port` | `7778` | First local loopback port the allocator hands out. Out-of-range values fall back to the default. |
| `instances.ssh_compression` | `true` | Add `-C` to the tunnel argv. See §5.2. |
| `instances.connect_timeout_secs` | unset (SSH `15.0`, SSM `25.0`) | How long (secs) to wait for the local forward port to accept connections before declaring a connect attempt failed. Hosts behind a ProxyCommand or jump host need longer (the proxy handshake runs before ssh begins the forward). An explicit value applies to both transports, including a value equal to either transport's default. Values below 1 fall back to the transport defaults; values above 120 are clamped to 120. |
| `instances.mint_timeout_secs` | unset (SSH `30.0`, SSM `90.0`) | How long (secs) to wait for the remote `kirocrew token` mint before failing a connect. The mint rides the same ssh transport as the tunnel, so a host behind a ProxyCommand or jump host pays the proxy handshake here too (the connect flow spawns two proxy-bound ssh children: `connect_timeout_secs` budgets the first, this budgets the second). An explicit value applies to both transports, including a value equal to either transport's default — size it for the slowest transport in use. Values below 10 fall back to the transport defaults; values above 120 are clamped with a warning. |
| `instances.max_recovery_attempts` | `8` | Consecutive self-heal attempts before the tunnel is left disconnected. Below 1 falls back to the default; above `MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS_CEILING` (100) is clamped with a warning, so a pathological setting cannot turn bounded self-heal into a near-infinite retry loop. |
| `instances.recover_backoff_max_secs` | `30.0` | Cap on the per-attempt backoff. Non-positive falls back to the default; above `RECOVER_BACKOFF_MAX_CEILING_SECS` (300) is clamped, bounding the worst-case wall-clock recovery window. |
| `instances.probe_failure_threshold` | `3` | Consecutive health-probe failures before a non-forwarding tunnel is torn down. Below 1 falls back to the default. |

```bash
kirocrew config set instances.warm_set_cap 3
kirocrew config set instances.ssh_compression false
kirocrew config set instances.connect_timeout_secs 45
kirocrew config set instances.mint_timeout_secs 60
```

Constants that are **not** user-configurable: the probe interval (30s), the token
refresh fraction (0.8), and the stored-token probe timeout (2s).

**Which of these a config write reaches (`SshTunnelManager.apply_config`).** The
manager registers `live.watch_section(self, "instances", method="apply_config",
fail_closed=False)` in its own `__init__` — `method` because the `reconfigure`
name is already taken here, and `fail_closed=False` because the section carries
no authorization, so a degraded document's defaults are the right answer. A config
write pushes `connect_timeout_secs`, `mint_timeout_secs`, `ssh_compression`,
`max_recovery_attempts`, `recover_backoff_max_secs` and `probe_failure_threshold`
onto the running manager. Every one of those is consulted per operation — per
connect, per mint, per recovery attempt — so pushing it is a genuine hot apply
rather than a value that only mattered at construction. The probe threshold is
additionally propagated into the tunnels ALREADY running: each one copied it when
it was built, and would otherwise keep tearing itself down on the old count. The
push is an attribute set on the live tunnel, not a restart, because the threshold
is compared against a running counter — so the new value takes effect on the next
probe without dropping a healthy forward.

`tunnel_base_port` is deliberately left alone. The allocator has already handed out
ports from the old base and live tunnels hold them, so moving the base mid-flight
would only fragment the range; it applies to a manager built after the change.
`instances.enabled` stays a startup read (§1), and `warm_set_cap` is applied by the
warm table rather than here.

`apply_config` is not `reconfigure`: the latter is the per-instance edit barrier
described under `PATCH /api/instances/{id}`, which tears one tunnel down and
rewrites its coordinates under the manager lock. They share no code.

### 5.2 `instances.ssh_compression`

Adds `-C` (zlib transport compression) to the supervised `ssh -N -L` argv. It is
on by default, and the reasoning is specific to what travels over this one
forwarded stream: the *entire* remote dashboard, meaning the SPA bundle on first
connect plus every subsequent API and WebSocket frame. That payload is
JS/HTML/JSON, which compresses well, and the gateway does **not** gzip its HTTP
responses, so `-C` is the only compression anywhere in the path and nothing is
double-compressed. The dominant deployment is a dedicated remote gateway host
reached over a higher-latency link, where spending remote CPU to save bandwidth
is the right trade. On a fast or local link the CPU cost can outweigh the
bandwidth win, which is why it stays tunable.

The flag is held on the `SshTunnelManager` and re-read from config on every write
(§5.1), but each `_SshTunnel` copies it into its argv when the child is spawned, so
a change applies to tunnels built AFTER it — a live forward keeps the setting it
started with until it reconnects. Only the *tunnel* argv is affected. The
token-mint and diagnostics `ssh` invocations do not compress (they are single short
commands, so there is nothing to gain).

### 5.3 Registry file

`~/.kiro/crew/instances.json`, one record per instance:

```
id, name, ssh_host, remote_port (default 5476), local_port (0 = unallocated),
ttl (default "20h"), remote_bin, was_connected, forwarder_pid (0 = none),
forwarder_start ("" = unknown), forwarder_sig ("" = unsigned)
```

plus a top-level `last_active_id`. `id` is a slug (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,62}$`)
derived from `name` when not given, with a numeric suffix on collision. The file
holds **connection coordinates only**: no credentials or tokens are ever written
there. Every anchored validator in this package ends with `\Z`, never `$`: Python's `$` also matches just before a trailing newline, so a `"20h\n"` would pass a `$`-anchored check and then reach an ssh/ssm argument list carrying an embedded newline. `ttl` is validated against the SAME bound the token minters enforce
(`^[1-9][0-9]{0,3}[hm]$`): a value this layer accepted but they rejected would
persist and then fail at the next connect, blaming the tunnel for a bad edit.

Two persisted hints drive lazy reconnect:

- `was_connected` is sticky "connection intent". It is set when a tunnel opens
  and cleared **only** on an explicit user disconnect, deliberately surviving
  gateway shutdown and a failed auto-revive, so the frontend keeps the entry in an
  error / click-to-reconnect state instead of dropping it. It is also what the
  frontend keys entry visibility on (`was_connected || connected || warm`).
- `last_active_id` records the instance most recently connected to. `connect()`
  writes it and `remove()` clears it, and any value that no longer resolves to a
  live record is dropped on the next write. Nothing in the gateway reads it:
  startup revive keys on `was_connected` and revives *every* intended instance,
  not just one, and the active pane is frontend state. `get_last_active()` is the
  only reader and has no production caller.

A third hint pair, `forwarder_pid` + `forwarder_start`, exists for crash
recovery rather than reconnect intent: `connect()` records the spawned
forwarder child's pid and its opaque `platform_compat.process_start_time`
identity next to `local_port` (one write), and a successful self-heal rebuild
moves both to the replacement child. A gateway hard-kill (SIGKILL/crash) never
runs teardown, so the forwarder survives, reparented to init, still holding its
port and its session to the remote. The next `connect()` reclaims exactly that
child, best-effort (a failed reclaim never fails the connect). The registry is
agent-writable state, so a recorded claim is honored only when it
authenticates: the record must carry `forwarder_sig`, the gateway's own HMAC
over (instance id, pid, start time, port) under a key derived from the SEL
trust root (`sel_hmac_key_path()`, domain-separated exactly like the
`session_pid_sig` sidecar protocol) — a root an agent can neither read nor
replace, so a record written, edited, or re-pointed by anything but the
gateway fails verification outright and nothing is ever signalled for it.
Behind the MAC, defense in depth from kernel-owned facts: the candidate must
be a genuine ORPHAN — not a pid this manager currently supervises, and
reparented to init (`get_ppid == 1`), which no live gateway's forwarder is
(subreaper hosts read as non-orphaned and merely miss the reclaim). Then, iff
the recorded
`local_port` probes occupied AND both identity halves are recorded AND the
pid's live start time equals the recorded one AND its **full argv exactly
equals** the forward command line the manager would construct for the recorded
port (`platform_compat.process_argv_matches_exact`), it is signalled — SIGTERM
escalating to SIGKILL on a bounded grace, with the start-time identity
**re-verified before the SIGKILL** (the grace window is exactly where a pid can
exit and be recycled); pid-scoped for ssh, whose child shares the dead
gateway's process group; group-scoped for SSM, whose child owns its group, with
completion judged by the whole group being gone and the port actually
releasing. Anything short of full identity — either hint missing, start time
differing or unreadable, argv unreadable (always the case on Windows, so the
guard fails closed there), or any argv element differing — means the identity
cannot be confirmed: the process is left alone (logged, and SEL-audited when
anything was signalled) and allocation simply skips its port; the freed port
returns to the pool at the next allocation rather than being re-taken by the
same connect. Reclamation is keyed on the manager's OWN recorded identity,
never a process-table scan — matching the table by argv pattern is what once
SIGTERMed forwards operators had opened themselves (#1972).

`disconnect()` resets `local_port` to the unallocated sentinel together with
`was_connected` and the forwarder identity pair in one write, so a freed port
is never left reserved and a stale identity never reaches a later reclaim's
checks.

## 6. API (owner-only control plane)

All routes are gated by `_guard()`: **deny-by-default**. It rejects a
Slack-origin request (an `X-Session-Key` starting `slack:`) with `403`, rejects a
request with no `request["user"]` with `401`, and rejects a disabled feature with
`403`. Every call, success and denial alike, emits a SEL audit event
(`instances_<operation>`).

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/instances` | List instances + live status + `warm_set_cap` + `active`. |
| `POST /api/instances` | Add an instance. A rejection carries a machine-readable `code` beside its human message, so a client can branch without parsing prose: `invalid_json` / `invalid_body` (unreadable request), `invalid_field` (a named field failed validation), `instance_duplicate` (the name is taken), `instance_invalid` (the record as a whole is not addressable) and `instances_manager_unavailable`. The dashboard forwards the code into its error → agent hand-off, which is why it has to be on the wire rather than derived from the message. |
| `PATCH /api/instances/{id}` | Edit `name`/`ssh_host`/`remote_port`/`ttl`/`remote_bin`/`connection_method`/`ssm_target`/`ssm_run_as`/`aws_profile`/`aws_region` (`id` and internal hints are not editable). Editing a field the tunnel is BUILT from (everything except `name` and `ttl`) disconnects a live tunnel first, because it would otherwise keep forwarding the old port to the old host under the new label; the teardown passes `keep_intent=True` so it does not touch `was_connected` — that flag records a USER disconnect, so a reconfiguration leaves it alone and a real disconnect arriving mid-edit still wins. The crew therefore keeps its switcher entry and reconnects in one click. The teardown and the coordinate rewrite happen as ONE operation, `SshTunnelManager.reconfigure()`, which holds the manager lock across both. Done as two steps a `connect` can read the OLD record in between, and whether its tunnel is already CONNECTED or still CONNECTING when the write lands decides whether any after-the-fact sweep would notice it — so the window is removed rather than narrowed: a racing `connect` either completes before (and is torn down inside the section) or starts after (and reads the new coordinates). It also cancels and AWAITS that instance's in-flight self-heal first: recovery reads the record before it takes the lock, so a recovery already running carries the pre-edit coordinates and would reinstall a tunnel to the old machine. Because that cancellation itself awaits, a reconfiguration additionally raises a per-instance BARRIER before its first await; while the barrier is up the scheduling seams refuse to start work — `_on_tunnel_exit` will not begin a self-heal, a backed-off one returns without acting, and `_schedule_token_refresh` will not restart a mint loop — so nothing can slip into the window. Self-heal is cancelled AND awaited before the coordinates move, because it rebuilds from the record it read. The token-refresh loop is unwound by the teardown instead — after the stop succeeds — so a REJECTED edit leaves the live tunnel holding both its credential and its refresh; in both cases the cancellation is awaited, since a mint already in flight would otherwise store a token for a tunnel that is being replaced. A teardown that raises ABORTS the edit with `503` / `code: tunnel_teardown_failed` and persists nothing: a stop that failed leaves the old forward live, so advancing the record would describe one machine while the still-open tunnel serves another — and that tunnel is the one the user reaches. Nothing is discarded unless the stop succeeded — the tunnel keeps its place in `_tunnels` along with its token and refresh task — so a failed stop can neither leave an untracked process holding the port nor a live forward without a credential. The registry write is also shielded from cancellation: a client hanging up mid-write must not unwind the `async with` and free the lock while the write is still in flight. An edit sends only the fields that DIFFER from an IMMUTABLE snapshot of the record taken when its form opened (not the live polled record, which a concurrent CLI edit would move under the user), so the later of two concurrent saves cannot revert the earlier one's corrections; optional fields travel as explicit empty values, so emptying one clears it instead of being read as "leave as-is". The dashboard does NOT reconnect afterwards: any automatic reconnect races an explicit Disconnect arriving mid-save, so the row offers **Connect** instead. A crew CORRELATED to a cloud stack has its `connection_method`/`ssm_target`/`aws_profile`/`aws_region` frozen in the edit form and omitted from the request — Stop/Start/Delete resolve the machine through those, so editing them would strand a billing instance. That freeze is now enforced **server-side too**: this endpoint rejects the four addressing fields for a correlated cloud instance with `400` / `code: cloud_instance_addressing_locked`, so a non-dashboard caller (CLI, script, the agent driving this owner-only API) can no longer rewrite the coordinates and strand a billing instance. Correlation is resolved against the cloud launch store via `_is_correlated_cloud_instance()`, checked against the record already fetched for the edit. An SSM crew that cannot be correlated is offered no lifecycle action, so its fields stay editable — that identity is how the dashboard finds the machine to stop or delete, and editing it away would strand a billing instance. |
| `DELETE /api/instances/{id}` | Disconnect then remove. |
| `POST /api/instances/{id}/connect` | Open tunnel + mint token. Returns the token. Idempotent by default; `?rebuild=1` (Retry after a load-watchdog verdict: tear down and re-spawn on a different local port) and `?only_if_connected=1` (auto-warm: answer an up tunnel, never bring one up — a down tunnel is a `200` with `code: instance_not_connected`) are the two opt-in exceptions, mutually exclusive (`400`), described in §4 step 1. A failure carries a machine-readable `code`, and that code is the failure-diagnosis ladder's OWN verdict (`ssh_unreachable`, `remote_down`, `tunnel_down`, …) promoted to the top level, so a client reads which link broke without walking into `diagnosis`. Only a verdict that is present AND **negative** is promoted: the stored diagnosis is the last ladder RUN, so a stale `ok` from before the failure would otherwise be published as this call's reason. With no usable verdict the stage that failed names itself — `instance_connect_failed`, or `instance_token_unconfirmed` when the tunnel came up but its credential did not confirm. The frontend applies the same present-AND-negative rule before quoting a verdict or its probe chain into the agent hand-off, for the same staleness reason. |
| `POST /api/instances/{id}/refresh-token` | Force a fresh mint and return the new token. See below. |
| `POST /api/instances/{id}/disconnect` | Tear down one tunnel. |
| `GET /api/instances/{id}/status[?diagnose=1]` | Live status; `?diagnose=1` runs the failure ladder and merges the result. |
| `POST /api/instances/{id}/restart` | Restart the remote gateway over SSH. |
| `GET /api/instances/{id}/capabilities` | What a CONNECTED peer can do, for a local session bound to it: `version` (+ `local_version` and the `version_match` gate the relay enforces), `agents` + `default_agent`, `models`, `effort_levels`, `workspaces` + `default_workspace`. Aggregates five fixed peer reads (`/api/version`, `/api/agents`, `/api/models`, `/api/effort-levels`, `/api/workspaces`) through `SshTunnelManager.peer_capability` — a closed path set, deliberately NOT the prefix-fenced proxy above, which would have granted the peer's mutating `PUT /api/agents/{name}` in the same stroke. The reads fan out concurrently, each under `DEFAULT_CAPABILITY_PROXY_TIMEOUT_SECS` (8s) except `/api/models`, which gets `DEFAULT_MODELS_CAPABILITY_PROXY_TIMEOUT_SECS` (20s): the model list is the one read whose COLD path runs bounded subprocess work on the peer (up to 5s sandbox-backend detection + up to 10s `kiro-cli chat --list-models`, ~15s worst case), so an 8s budget killed every cold read and reported a healthy peer as `capability_unreachable` (#10621). One failed read does not fail the request: the reply is a PARTIAL document with the miss named per-field in `unavailable` (`capability_unreachable`, `capability_unauthorized`, `capability_peer_too_old`, …), so the frontend disables exactly that control. The dashboard (`useRemoteCapabilities`) re-polls a partial document every 8s while the peer is version-compatible and the per-field code is the transient `capability_unreachable` — never for version-skewed, disconnected, or terminally-failing peers — and its model pickers render a loading row (`aria-busy`) rather than an empty list while the model roster is pending, and an inline `ErrorNotice` with in-place retry when the read itself fails — an empty list would claim the peer offers no models. Replies are untrusted input: every string crosses the redact + clamp chain (`_cap_str` / `_cap_rows`, row cap 500) before reaching a picker. Owner-only, like the proxy and the federated search. |
| `ANY /api/instances/{id}/proxy/{path}` | Generic chat proxy — the carrier for the remote-crew chat view. Forwards a **bounded slice** of a CONNECTED peer's `/api/` surface over the already-open tunnel via `SshTunnelManager.proxy_request`, streaming the reply chunk-by-chunk (a proxied chat turn streams SSE for minutes, so the client timeout is connect + read-idle, never total). Credential rules match the federated search: the manager-held token travels as the port-scoped cookie and never reaches the browser; a `401/403` gets exactly one transparent re-mint retry; `allow_redirects=False` (a compromised peer answering 30x must not steer the hub — SSRF). Path policy is a **canonicalization**, not a pattern check, and runs before any URL is built: the caller's path is percent-decoded to a fixed point (bounded by `PROXY_PATH_MAX_DECODE_PASSES`, a deeper chain is refused), then every segment must be a plainly-named token — no empty segment, no all-dots segment, and only unreserved/sub-delim characters — and the forwarded path is **rebuilt from exactly those vetted segments**. Vetting the decoded form and forwarding the rebuilt one is what closes encoded traversal at any depth: a half-decoded `%252e%252e` matches no denylist rule yet still normalizes back into the control plane. On that canonical form the vet policy is a **positive prefix allowlist** (`_PROXY_ALLOWED_PREFIXES`, `api/chat` + `api/stream` today): only the peer's `api/chat` subtree and its `api/stream` event feed are forwarded — each a prefix grant, so every route under one is reachable, which is the chat feature's own wire surface — and everything outside the named prefixes is refused by default: the peer's own `api/instances` plane (one hub cannot chain through a peer into a third machine's SSH control plane), the peer's token-minting routes (whose JSON replies would carry a minted peer credential back through the hub in-band), and any endpoint the peer grows outside the allowlisted prefixes. `api/stream` is the peer's own SSE broadcast endpoint and the out-of-turn half of the chat view: the per-turn reply streams back from `api/chat`, while session-list and slot-state changes arrive on `api/stream`. It is deliberately that endpoint and **not** its WebSocket sibling `api/ws` — a WS row would need a `101 Switching Protocols` to cross this proxy, and the reply content-type gate below exists precisely to stop a peer serving anything but JSON/SSE onto the authenticated hub origin, so an upgrade would tunnel straight through it. Note what the row admits: that feed is per-client but not per-slot, so a hub holding it receives the peer's whole notification/slot broadcast rather than only the session on screen — peer content crossing to a hub user who is already the peer's owner (this route is owner-only), so it widens volume, not privilege, and is the reason it is a named row rather than a blanket `api/` grant. A new prefix is added to the constant explicitly, never by widening back to deny-only; the constant's exact value is pinned by a test so widening is always a reviewed act. Methods limited to GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE; inbound bodies capped at `PROXY_REQUEST_BODY_MAX_BYTES` before buffering. No browser Origin or cookies are forwarded to the peer (the hub presents as a same-origin loopback client), and the hub's own `?token=` credential is **stripped from the forwarded query** — the browser may authenticate the proxy request with it, and forwarding it would hand the peer a replayable hub credential. Replies are gated to an **allowlist**: only `application/json` and `text/event-stream` content types are forwarded (a compromised peer must not serve active content that executes on the hub origin), and only allowlisted headers (`Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`, `X-Accel-Buffering`) cross back — `Set-Cookie` and everything else is dropped, with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` added. Typed failures (`proxy_peer_not_connected`, `proxy_no_credential`, `proxy_unauthorized`, `proxy_peer_unreachable`) map to 5xx with a machine-readable `code`. |

**Two routes cross the token boundary, not one.** `connect` and `refresh-token`
both return a minted dashboard token in their response body, and they are the
**only** two that do. `refresh-token` exists because the browser needs to replace
an embedded pane's credential without tearing the tunnel down: proactively at
~80% of the TTL for a non-active pane, and reactively when an embedded dashboard
posts `mc-auth-expired` for the active pane (rate-limited client-side to one
re-mint per instance per 10s so a persistently-rejecting remote cannot spin a
reload storm). The invariant is the same on both: the token is delivered to the
authenticated owner only, is **never logged**, and **never** appears in a list or
status payload. The count is what to keep straight, since a single-route reading
would leave `refresh-token` out of any audit of where tokens leave the gateway:
the pair is `connect` + `refresh-token`, and nothing else.

Status codes worth knowing: `503` when the manager is not running (feature
enabled after startup), `404` for an unknown id, `502` when a connect, refresh,
or remote restart fails, and `400` on invalid add/update input (including a
locked addressing-field edit on a correlated cloud instance — see §7).

`restart` is wired end to end (route, handler, `restart_remote`, and an
`api.restartInstance` client method) but no dashboard surface calls it today, so
it is reachable only by an authenticated owner driving the API directly.

A token is stored against a tunnel GENERATION, not just against "some tunnel for
this instance". Every install bumps a per-instance counter; a mint captures the
counter before it starts (mints run without the manager lock, so a slow one must
not block connect/disconnect) and, under the lock, refuses to store its token if
the counter moved. Without that stamp the only check available is
`instance_id in self._tunnels`, which is true again for the REPLACEMENT tunnel —
so a mint in flight across an edit-plus-reconnect, or across a self-heal
reinstall, would overwrite the valid new token with one the current remote never
issued, and the embedded dashboard would be handed a dead credential. The stamp
covers every mint path rather than an enumerated list: the request-driven
`refresh_token()` the embedded dashboard calls is not a task in `_refresh_tasks`
and cannot be cancelled by name, so cancellation alone could never have reached
it. A refresh also refuses to START while the reconfiguration barrier is up,
since the coordinates it would read are about to move; the caller reports "no
token" and the client retries after the edit.

### 6.1 Why a transport edit tears the tunnel down instead of answering `409`

The obvious cheaper contract is to REFUSE a transport edit while a tunnel is live
(`409`, "disconnect first") and check-and-write under the existing lock. That
deletes `reconfigure()` and everything it carries — the per-instance barrier, the
recovery index, cancel-and-await on two task families, the shielded write — from a
manager that is already large. It was rejected for one reason: **a transport edit
is most often made because the tunnel is broken, and a broken tunnel is exactly
what does not report itself as down.** A crew whose host moved, whose port was
taken, or whose AMI runs a different remote user sits in `connected` or
`connecting` while being unusable; `409` would answer "disconnect first" to a user
who is editing precisely because connecting is what stopped working, and it hands
them a two-step where the failure mode of forgetting step one is a silent
mismatch between the record and the live forward.

The machinery is also not paid for by this feature alone. Every piece exists
because a tunnel's coordinates can change under a task that already read them —
which is equally true of the pre-existing self-heal and token-refresh loops, and
is where two of the bugs found during this PR's review actually lived. Making the
edit path safe hardened those seams rather than adding a new hazard: the barrier
is what stops a backed-off self-heal from reinstalling a tunnel to a machine the
user has moved on from, with or without an edit in flight.

What the design deliberately does NOT do is reconnect afterwards. Saving ends
disconnected and the row offers **Connect**, because any automatic reconnect races
an explicit Disconnect arriving mid-save. So the cost is bounded: the save closes
what its own edit invalidated, and never reopens anything on the user's behalf.

## 7. Security model

- **Owner-only, never via Slack.** A Slack-origin `X-Session-Key` is rejected;
  an authenticated dashboard session (`request["user"]`, set by the token-auth
  middleware) is positively required rather than assumed.
- **Loopback-only forwards.** `ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:<local>:127.0.0.1:<remote>`,
  with `AddressFamily=inet` to avoid an unexpected `::1` bind, `BatchMode=yes`
  so a missing credential fails fast instead of prompting, and
  `ExitOnForwardFailure=yes` so a forward that cannot bind is a detected failure
  rather than a silent hang. `-N` without `-f` is deliberate: `-f` would fork ssh
  into the background and leave the gateway unable to supervise or kill the real
  forwarder. The multiplexing pins in §9 close the same hole from the
  ssh_config side.
- **No local shell.** `ssh` is always spawned with an argv list, so `ssh_host`
  cannot inject local shell syntax; `ssh_host`/`remote_bin` are
  injection-validated immediately before every command line is built (§11).
- **Tokens.** Short-lived bearer tokens (`MAX_SESSION_TTL_SECS` caps the session
  at 20h) minted over SSH, returned only to the in-memory caller, never logged,
  and never present in list/status payloads. The mint's failure path carries a
  bounded stdout tail that is token-substituted and credential-redacted first,
  and the scan window is bounded because the redaction regexes hold the GIL.
- **postMessage relay.** The parent validates every embedded-frame
  `event.origin` against an exact loopback http origin (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`,
  or a single-label `*.localhost`) **and** requires the port to belong to a
  currently-warm tunnel before trusting any message. Only four message kinds
  cross the boundary: an unread count, an auth-expired signal, a switch-pane
  request (whose target is re-validated against the known instance list), and a
  readiness ping. The parent's outbound `postMessage` is addressed to the pane's
  exact origin, never `*`.
- **CSP.** `frame-ancestors` is `'self'` plus the exact parent origin carried in
  the minted token's signed `embed_parent_port` claim, never a wildcard and never
  a hardcoded port, so a local page with no validly-signed token can never frame
  the dashboard.
- **Untrusted ssh stderr.** A proxy banner is ANSI-stripped, credential- and
  exfiltration-redacted, and truncated before it is surfaced in status, and it is
  a secondary detail only: failure *classification* keys on real ssh signals, so
  banner prose can never be read as an auth verdict. When a classification phrase
  matched, the fixed-width truncation window is centered on the matched phrase
  rather than the head of the buffer -- on the phrase itself, not its line, since
  the proxy controls the buffer and can make a single line arbitrarily long -- so
  benign stderr written earlier (e.g. arbitrary `LocalCommand` output) cannot
  consume the budget and truncate the classified reason out of the surfaced
  detail.
- **Trust root.** `<data-home>/run/` (the run-marker dir) is on the
  `is_sensitive_path` floor, so agent file tools can neither read nor write it.
  See §12 and [security.md](security.md).
- **SEL audit trail.** Every control-plane action is audited, reads included.
- **Addressing fields locked for a correlated cloud instance.** `PATCH
  /api/instances/{id}` rejects an edit to `connection_method`/`ssm_target`/
  `aws_profile`/`aws_region` (`400`, `code: "cloud_instance_addressing_locked"`)
  when the instance's current `ssm_target` matches an EC2 instance id in the
  cloud launch job store (`kiro_crew.cloud.connect.is_launched_instance()`) —
  i.e. Kiro Crew provisioned it, as opposed to a hand-added SSM record. These
  four fields are how `coordsOf()` (`RemoteCrewPanel.tsx`) builds
  `{profile, region, instanceId}` for Stop/Start/Delete; rewriting them on a
  correlated instance leaves those actions unable to resolve the real EC2
  stack, which then keeps running and billing with no dashboard path to reach
  it. The dashboard already freezes these fields client-side for a correlated
  instance and never sends them; this is the server-side backstop for any
  other owner-authenticated caller (CLI, script, the agent itself). A
  hand-added SSM instance is unaffected — its `ssm_target` won't match any
  launch job, so the lock never engages.

---

## 8. Using it (step by step)

1. **Enable** on the hub: `kirocrew config set instances.enabled true && kirocrew restart`
   (or the Settings → Remote Instances toggle, then a restart).
2. Open the dashboard and go to **Settings → Remote Instances**. This panel is the
   control plane only; it does not embed remote dashboards.
3. **Add** an instance:
   - *Name*: any label.
   - *SSH host / alias*: what you would type after `ssh` (see §9).
   - *Remote port*: the port the remote gateway listens on. Instances may share
     it — the local forward port is allocated independently.
   - *Token TTL*: default `20h`.
   - *Remote kirocrew path*: only needed when `kirocrew` lives somewhere
     non-standard on the remote.
4. Click **Connect**. The hub opens the tunnel and mints a token.
5. **Switch** panes from the switcher dropdown in the top header (**Local**
   returns to your own dashboard). In the Electron shell, Cmd/Ctrl+digit jumps
   between panes in switcher order. Each row names its tunnel state in words on
   screen next to the status dot — colour is reinforcement, not the carrier, so
   the row that errored is findable without hovering every entry. Crews you switch
   between often can be PINNED beside the trigger as chips, so the switch costs no
   dropdown click — see [Pinned crew chips](#pinned-crew-chips).
6. **Diagnose** a flaky instance (runs the ladder), or **Disconnect** from its
   row. **Edit settings** / **Remove** live in the row's overflow menu — a row
   shows two primary actions plus that menu, so everything past them is one
   menu deep.

Every configured row carries separate source and transport badges from the
instance record. `connection_method="ssm"` shows **SSM**; every other transport
shows **SSH**. A record whose persisted `provisioner_id` is `aws_ec2` also shows
**EC2**, independently of launch-job history. `provisioner_id` is stamped by
`register_instance` on each EC2 registration and relaunch; a record created
before the field existed carries `""` until its next relaunch, and until then
the launch-job correlation supplies the EC2 badge and posture. A hand-added
record with no known provisioner shows only its transport rather than being
guessed into an EC2 category.

One residual for operators: an EC2 row registered before `provisioner_id`
existed whose launch job has since been garbage-collected shows only its
transport badge, and Remove on it is NOT confirm-gated — Remove could stop a
billing machine without a warning — until a relaunch stamps it. Relaunch the
crew to get the guard now, or check the AWS console before removing. A one-time
heuristic backfill was judged and rejected: stamping rows whose `ssm_target`
sits in a known launcher region would mis-stamp hand-added SSM crews in that
region, and a wrong `aws_ec2` stamp produces a false billing warning and a
false "delete it in the AWS console" remedy on a machine the launcher never
created. `provisioner_id` is data the launcher records at registration, not a
guess inferred later.

Renaming a crew is done from **Edit settings**: its Name field writes through
the same `PATCH /api/instances/{id}` as every other field, and the registry
persists the new name. A successful save invalidates the shared instances
query, updating the list and pane labels; an API rejection stays beside the
open draft instead of closing the form. The held draft is keyed only by crew,
so an in-app route remount reopens that crew's full form, and choosing Edit
settings again on the same row reuses the draft. Switching to another row while
a draft exists is refused until Save or Cancel, so unsaved work is never
cleared by changing rows.

A save is bound to the form that started it. While its request is in flight, that
form freezes its fields, Save, and Rebase. The exit button reads "Stop waiting"
while pending and stays enabled. It aborts the request client-side, refreshes
the instances list, and returns the form to editable with its typed draft kept.
The client cannot tell whether that save landed; the refreshed list shows the
current state. An inline status names that outcome and offers
Save again or Cancel. The refresh shows a save the gateway already applied;
stopping the wait does not undo it. When no save is pending, the button reads
"Cancel". Navigating away also aborts the request; the held draft is restored on
remount, enabled for another save. The server may still apply a request despite
the client cancellation, even after that one refresh;
the shared `['instances']` cache is re-read every 60 seconds by the instances
viewport and on window focus, so the list shows the server's record within a
minute. If the record changed meanwhile, the shared Rebase path reconciles the
restored draft with the record that exists now.

An unsaved edit is held by the PANEL, keyed by crew, not by the form component.
The crew list unmounts for any number of reasons the form cannot see — switching
to the **Set up a new one** tab is enough — and an edit whose only home was the
form's own state came back silently reverted to the stored record. Because a
guard can only refuse the exits it enumerates, the values are lifted instead of
defended: the form is re-seeded from that draft when it remounts. The draft carries
its **baseline** — the record it was typed against — and not just the values:
re-deriving the baseline from the current `inst` on remount would rebase a stale
draft onto a newer poll, so a port someone changed from the CLI meanwhile would
read as a difference and be written back to its old value by a save the user
thought only touched the host. One snapshot anchors everything: `dirty` and the
request body both measure against that baseline, so a restored draft is unsaved
work rather than a clean form, and a field the user never touched is never a
difference. Only three things clear it: **Cancel** (the user choosing
to discard), a successful save, and the crew ceasing to exist. That last one is
anchored to the crew's EXISTENCE rather than to the Remove button, so a removal
from the CLI or a cloud Delete clears it too — ids are derived from the name, so a
crew added afterwards can land on the same id, and a surviving draft would remount
on a different machine and let Save overwrite settings the user never typed. It is
gated on a SUCCESSFUL poll, so an errored fetch is not read as "all crews gone"
and does not throw unsaved work away.

A live id is not proof of a live RECORD, though: a crew removed and recreated under
the same derived id between two polls never leaves the list. So the draft is also
checked against the record's **machine-addressing** fields (`connection_method`,
`ssh_host`, `remote_port`, `ssm_target`, `aws_profile`, `aws_region`). When one of
those moved externally, the form says so, names the fields, and **withholds Save**
until the user adopts the current record. This is deliberately not a silent choice
either way, because the two situations that produce the signal are
indistinguishable from the client and want opposite outcomes: a concurrent CLI edit
should keep the user's typing, while a replacement must never receive it — only the
person looking at the row can tell which happened. A label or lifetime changed
elsewhere does NOT trigger it: that cannot make this a different crew, and the
baseline diff already stops the save from reverting it.

Adopting the record is a **three-way merge**, with the draft's original baseline as
the merge base: fields the user typed are kept, every field they did not touch is
taken from the record that exists now, and the baseline advances to it. Keeping the
old values wholesale would convert untouched-but-stale fields into deliberate
writes — the very clobber the baseline exists to prevent.

A save that tore the tunnel down also drops the crew's WARM pane. That pane is an
iframe holding the old local port and token, so once the tunnel behind it is gone
it cannot be revived by reconnecting — it would reuse a credential the new tunnel
never issued and sit on 403. The decision reads the saved record's own status
rather than guessing from which fields changed, so a name-or-ttl-only edit (which
tears nothing down) keeps its working pane. Opening a DIFFERENT crew's editor while one
holds unsaved changes is still refused outright — that is about two editors being
open at once, not about the unmount — and the refusal renders at the row that was
clicked, since the menu has already closed by then.

### Pinned crew chips

Switching between two crews through the dropdown costs a click every time. Any
entry — including **Local** — can be PINNED from the pin icon on its own dropdown
row (lit for pinned, unlit outline for not), which lifts it out of the menu into
an always-visible chip beside the trigger. Nothing is pinned by default, so a
single-crew user pays no header width for the feature and sees no chip row at all.

The pin sits on the row rather than in a second list of the same crews below it,
and it is a SIBLING menu item of the row's switch target rather than a button
inside it: a `menuitemradio` may not contain another interactive element, so a
nested pin would be invalid ARIA and unreachable by the menu's own arrow keys.
Clicking a pin toggles it and leaves the menu open, so several crews can be
pinned in one visit without navigating anywhere.

Pinning is per crew rather than one expand-everything switch because the header's
budget is a PIXEL budget, not a crew count: three crews named after real hosts
outgrow it while six short names fit. Choosing WHICH crews are worth header space
is what keeps that budget spendable on the ones actually being switched between.

| Concern | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Storage | `localStorage` key `mc-crew-switcher-pinned`, a JSON array of instance ids (`__local__` for the local dashboard). A module-level store broadcasts changes, because several bars in one realm are mounted at once and hidden with `display:none` rather than unmounted — a per-component hook would leave a hidden bar on a stale value until it remounted. A remote pane's embedded bar is a separate cross-origin realm and so carries its own pin set. |
| Migration | The predecessor was one expand-everything flag, `mc-crew-switcher-expanded`. On first read a `'1'` there migrates to a pinned **Local** rather than to an empty set: that user wanted chips, and migrating them to nothing would read as the feature having been removed. The legacy key is dropped in the same pass. |
| Order | The crew on screen leads as its own chip, then the pinned chips, then the dropdown. The dropdown TRAILS the chips so it stays adjacent to the last one and reads as "and the rest"; it carries the aggregate unread for every crew not on screen, clipped ones included. The active crew is never also a pinned chip — two copies of one name would spend the budget twice. |
| Width bound | None of its own. The switcher sits in the topbar's left grid track (`minmax(0,1fr)`) inside `.tb-left`, which carries `min-width:0` and `overflow:hidden`, so the track structurally prevents it from reaching the centered search column — see [the three-track topbar](#pinned-crew-chips). Earlier revisions of this feature carried a `vw`-derived `max-width` because the search overlay was absolutely positioned and a left-side cluster could squeeze it; the grid layout removed that failure mode along with the need for the cap. |
| Overflow | The row is a single `nowrap` line with `overflow: hidden`, and the chip at the boundary is CUT rather than dropped. Wrapping into a hidden second row would keep every chip whole, but a wrapped row still holds its full ALLOCATED width with the wrapped chips' space empty — which pushes the trailing dropdown away from the last visible chip by a gap that changes with the viewport. Filling the row keeps the two adjacent (measured at the 4px flex gap, asserted by the capture harness). A trailing fade marks the cut edge, so a cut chip reads as "there is more, in the dropdown next to me" rather than as a rendering fault. Cut chips stay reachable in the dropdown, whose row marks them *no room* so a pin with no visible chip does not read as a pin that failed. |

**Why the switcher needs no width cap.** The topbar is a three-track CSS grid:
`minmax(0,1fr) | clamp(240px,22vw,480px) | minmax(0,1fr)`. The search column is a
flow-internal track, not an absolutely positioned overlay, so a wide left cluster
cannot reach it: `.tb-left` is `min-width:0` with `overflow:hidden`, and the track
simply gives the chips less room. That is the whole bound, and it holds at every
viewport width and under the macOS Electron 84px header inset (which narrows the
tracks rather than shifting content over them).

This is worth stating because the obvious alternative is wrong in a way that
already shipped once: a hardcoded fraction. `max-w-[42vw]` on the chip row reached
~538px at 1280px, which under the previous absolutely-positioned search overlay
pushed its available space under the minimum width and unmounted it outright. A
fraction cannot track a viewport-relative sibling; a grid track does it by
construction.


Counting which chips were cut off is read-only and one-directional: the result is
consumed only by the dropdown's rows, which are portalled and contribute nothing
to the header's width, so nothing sized by the measurement lives inside the thing
being measured. The dropdown's own unread badge is absolutely positioned for the
same reason — appearing must not change the button's width, since the chip row is
sized from the space that button leaves. The rule itself (a chip whose trailing
edge passes the row's visible width is cut) is a pure function, `clippedChipIds`,
because jsdom performs no layout and a rendered test could never distinguish a
fitted row from a clipped one. `offsetLeft` is only sound there because the row
carries `position: relative`, making it the chips' offsetParent and putting both
in the same coordinate space as its `clientWidth`.

## 9. Remote host types

The only thing that varies per remote is the **SSH host** you configure: the hub
always runs a fixed `ssh <ssh_host> ...` argv (`BatchMode=yes`,
`ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`, `ServerAliveInterval=30`, `ServerAliveCountMax=3`,
`AddressFamily=inet`, `ControlPath=none`, `ControlMaster=no`, `-L`/`-N`, plus `-C` <!-- wokeignore:rule=master -->
when compression is on). Anything `ssh` can reach **non-interactively** works.
`ssh_host` accepts `host`, `host.fqdn`, an `~/.ssh/config` alias, or
`user@host`, and rejects any segment starting with `-` (ssh option-injection
guard).

**Multiplexing is pinned off; everything else is inherited.** A tunnel is a
supervised foreground child, and a forward the gateway cannot supervise or kill
reports as `ssh exited with code 0` while it is in fact still serving. A
multiplexed session does exactly that — ssh hands the forward to an existing
shared connection and exits. `ControlPath=none` is the enforcement: with no path
resolved there is no socket to join. `ControlMaster=no` states the policy, and <!-- wokeignore:rule=master -->
is not sufficient alone — an inherited `ControlPath` still routes into a shared
connection.

Everything else per-host — `User`, `IdentityFile`, `Port`, `ProxyJump`,
`ProxyCommand` — is still inherited from `~/.ssh/config`; the registry carries no
inline equivalents and depends on that. **Pinning a directive the user may also
set is not free**: ssh takes the first value obtained and reads the command line
first, so a pinned `-o` silently discards theirs. The two multiplexing pins are
safe because a supervised tunnel must never share a connection, but the same
move on, say, `IgnoreUnknown` would drop the pattern a cross-platform config
relies on and turn a working setup into `Bad configuration option`.

The diagnostics probes are a different case and are left alone: they are
one-shot commands whose exit status is the whole result, with no forward to own.

### Dev host / home server (primary)

Use your SSH config alias or `user@hostname`. As long as a key in your
`ssh-agent` (or the default identity) covers auth, `BatchMode` succeeds without
prompting and no key path is needed.

### EC2 (and other key-based hosts)

EC2 differs from a directly-reachable dev host in three ways that matter here:

| Aspect | Direct dev host | EC2 |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| Auth | key in `ssh-agent` / default identity | key pair (`-i key.pem`), or SSM Session Manager |
| Login user | resolved by your ssh config | `ec2-user`, `ubuntu`, `admin`, and so on: must be explicit |
| Reachability | direct | often via a bastion (ProxyJump) or SSM-only (no public SSH) |

**Recommended: configure an SSH alias.** Because `ssh_host` accepts an alias, put
the EC2-specific bits in `~/.ssh/config` on the **hub** and reference the alias.
The fixed `ssh <alias> ...` argv inherits all of it:

```ssh-config
# ~/.ssh/config on the hub
Host my-ec2
  HostName ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  User ec2-user
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my-key.pem
  # Optional: reach a private instance through a bastion ...
  ProxyJump bastion-host
  # ... or via SSM Session Manager (no inbound SSH needed):
  # ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters portNumber=%p"
```

Then add an instance with **SSH host / alias = `my-ec2`**. Prerequisites on the
hub: a passphrase-less key (or an `ssh-agent` already holding it, since
`BatchMode` will not prompt), and `kirocrew` installed with a gateway running on
the instance's loopback port.

Simpler cases work without an alias: `ec2-user@10.0.1.5` and
`ubuntu@ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com` are both accepted `ssh_host`
values, provided the matching key is the default identity or in the agent.

**The cloud launcher registers instances here.** `kirocrew cloud launch`
best-effort registers the box it created in this registry using the **native SSM
transport** — `connection_method="ssm"` with the EC2 instance id as `ssm_target`,
plus the launcher's `aws_profile`/`aws_region` (`cloud/connect.py:register_instance`).
The dashboard then tunnels, refreshes tokens, and self-heals the box over SSM with
no SSH key, no inbound port, and no hand-edited `~/.ssh/config`. `kirocrew cloud
destroy` unregisters it (matched by `ssm_target`) after deletion confirms. This is
why `cloud/connect.py` cites this section, and why its numbering must not move.
The legacy `ssm_proxy_ssh_host` helper (registering the id as `ssh_host` behind an
`~/.ssh/config` `ProxyCommand`) is retained for reference only and is no longer
used by the managed path.

### Provisioning from the dashboard (`/api/cloud/*`)

The Remote Instances settings page can create an EC2 instance in the user's own AWS
account without dropping to the CLI. `dashboard/handlers_cloud.py` exposes the
launcher behind the same owner-only guard as `/api/instances/*`: an
authenticated owner (`request["user"]`), non-Slack, POSIX only, `403` otherwise.

**The two read-only launch routes are the POSIX exception.** `GET
/api/cloud/launch` and `GET /api/cloud/launch/{id}` parse a local job store and
shell to nothing, so they answer on every platform (`_guard(..., posix_only=False)`);
everything that can provision, stop or terminate stays POSIX-gated with
`400 posix_host_required`. The list is what makes the crew rows classifiable
(cloud-launched vs hand-added), and the panel waits for it before rendering
anything — so gating it on Windows replaced the whole Remote Crew list, SSH rows
included, with a cloud-provisioning error and no way to connect or remove
anything. On a Windows host the route answers with whatever launch history is
persisted in the config dir — normally nothing, since nothing there could have
created a job, though a config dir carried over from a POSIX host still reports
its real jobs.

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/cloud/preflight?profile=&region=` | AWS reachability + the prerequisite checklist (the doctor checks as JSON). |
| `GET /api/cloud/iam-policy` | The minimum IAM policy document to paste into the user's account. |
| `GET /api/cloud/provisioners` | The lanes the Set-up tab may offer: `{id, kind, label, posix_only, steps}` per provisioner, from the CPP `remote_provisioners` seam ([platform-context.md](platform-context.md)). The stock build lists the single `aws_ec2` lane. Answers on every platform, like the two history routes: the tab needs it to pick a form, and each row's `posix_only` carries the platform answer for that lane. Adding a lane: [adding-a-remote-provisioner.md](../../guides/adding-a-remote-provisioner.md). |
| `GET /api/cloud/launch` | List launch jobs, in progress and finished. |
| `POST /api/cloud/launch` | Start a launch job; returns the job immediately. `409` when one is already in flight. Body `{provider_id?, profile, region, size_key}`; `provider_id` defaults to `aws_ec2`, and an id the seam does not list or cannot back answers `400 unknown_provisioner` before any job file exists. The job carries `provider_id`, and its step labels are the provisioner's. |
| `GET /api/cloud/launch/{id}` | Poll one job: per-step state plus the device-code prompt while signing in. |
| `POST /api/cloud/launch/{id}/cancel` | Request cancellation; honored between steps and inside the sign-in wait. A cancel during provisioning is acted on when the deploy returns, and the stack it created is rolled back. It also stops the remote `kiro-cli login` **before** that rollback and regardless of whether the rollback confirms: teardown can end in `DELETE_FAILED`, and an instance that survives with a login still polling would sign the crew in minutes after the owner cancelled. Stopping the login is deliberately not a `logout` — the box may hold an older session the cancelled attempt never touched. |
| `POST /api/cloud/launch/{id}/signin` | Acknowledge the device-code prompt (`409` when none is pending). |
| `POST /api/cloud/launch/{id}/signin/restart` | Re-run **only** the sign-in step on a crew that already exists, for a launch that finished unsigned: a fresh device code, run with the job's stored `login_target` so a company-SSO crew is not retried through a Builder ID prompt. Owner-only; never re-provisions. `400` when the job never created a crew, `409` while any launch or sign-in is already running on it. The RUNNING transition is persisted under the launch lock that admitted the request, so a second restart arriving in that window cannot pass the same check. |
| `POST /api/cloud/{tag}/stop` | Stop the instance behind a stack tag. |
| `POST /api/cloud/{tag}/start` | Start it again. |
| `DELETE /api/cloud/{tag}` | Terminate the stack (`wait=False`; a denied human-action check surfaces as `403`). |

**A launch is a durable job, not a request.** It outlives both the HTTP call and
the browser tab: `cloud/launch_job.py` writes one JSON file per job under
`<config_dir>/run/cloud-launch-jobs/` (the `run/` tree is on the sensitive-path
floor, so an awaiting-sign-in job's device code is not readable by agent file
tools) and rewrites it after **every** state
transition, so progress survives navigating away and a reload. The steps are
`preflight → provision → signin → connect`, and
`RealLaunchEngine` (`cloud/launch_engine.py`) binds them to the existing
`iam.reachability_check`, `ec2.deploy`, `login.start_device_login` and
`connect.register_instance` — the dashboard path adds no AWS logic of its own,
and registration lands in this registry exactly as the CLI's does.

**A restart does not resume a launch — it terminalizes it.** The worker is a
daemon thread, so a gateway restart takes it with the process while the job file
still reads `running`. `LaunchJobStore.reap_orphans()` runs on first store use in
a new process and marks every non-terminal job it does not own as `failed`
("interrupted"), because the alternative is worse than an error: a progress card
that can never advance, and a `cancel` that returns 200 while signalling a thread
that no longer exists. Ownership is tracked (`adopt()`) so a live process never
reaps its own in-flight jobs. The CloudFormation stack may well have completed in
AWS, so the message points the user at their crew list rather than implying
nothing was created.

One shape is parked rather than failed: a job whose connect step already ran.
The crew exists and is registered, so `failed` would hide a working instance
behind a red card. It is parked `done` with the sign-in step skipped and — when
the sign-in never confirmed — its device code **kept**. The remote `kiro-cli
login` is `nohup`'d on the instance and outlives the gateway, so the code it is
polling for is still live; discarding the local record would leave a poller
nothing tracks, whose approval signs the crew in silently. Kept, the job lands in
the stale-code shape the dashboard already serves: **I approved it — check now**
re-probes the box and clears the badge if the approval landed, and **Get a new
sign-in code** replaces the login (killing the old poller) if it did not.

Because the gateway cannot answer the device login on the user's behalf, a job
parks in `awaiting_signin` with the verification URL and user code exposed as
job state until the owner confirms it in the browser.

### What is reachable through which mechanism

| Need | Where it goes |
|------|---------------|
| Custom login user | `user@host` in `ssh_host`, or `User` in an ssh-config `Host` block |
| FQDN / IP target | direct `ssh_host` value |
| Identity file | `IdentityFile` in an ssh-config `Host` block (there is no inline field) |
| Non-22 SSH port | `Port` in an ssh-config `Host` block (there is no inline field) |
| Bastion / ProxyJump | `ProxyJump` / `ProxyCommand` in an ssh-config `Host` block |
| SSM-only instances | `ProxyCommand` with `aws ssm start-session` |

The registry deliberately carries no inline `-i` / `-p` / `-J` fields. The
ssh-config alias path covers every case above, including bastions and SSM, which
inline flags could not express, and it keeps the hub's argv fixed: a
user-controlled `-i` path would be a new injection surface on a command line
whose current variable parts are all charset-bound literals.

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---------|--------------------|
| Settings → Remote Instances shows the opt-in card | `instances.enabled` is false. Set it and restart. |
| Enabled but the panel says "not active" | The flag was set after the gateway started; the SSH manager is created at startup only. Restart. |
| Iframe is blank or black | The pane's embedded SPA never announced readiness within 15s, so the error panel with **Retry** appears (Retry force-reloads even an identical src). An iframe reports no load error to its parent, so this watchdog is the only signal. |
| Connect fails with an SSH auth error | Refresh your SSH credentials (re-add the key to `ssh-agent`); `BatchMode` never prompts, so a missing credential is an immediate failure. Tunnels self-heal once auth is restored. |
| Connect fails for another reason | Use **Diagnose**. The ladder reports the first broken link: `ssh_unreachable` (check SSH access or the host alias), `remote_down` (remote gateway not listening), `not_connected` (SSH and remote are fine, this instance has no tunnel yet: click Connect), or `tunnel_down` (reconnect). |
| "local port N was taken while connecting" | The allocator picked a port that something grabbed in the moment before `ssh` bound it. Retry. If it persists, stop whatever keeps taking ports in that range or move `instances.tunnel_base_port` to a quieter one. |
| Instance keeps dropping | The health probe plus 2-tier self-heal retry over roughly a two-minute window (8 attempts, capped-exponential backoff). Tune `instances.max_recovery_attempts` / `recover_backoff_max_secs` / `probe_failure_threshold`; both recovery values are clamped so they cannot loop indefinitely. If self-heal gives up, diagnosis runs automatically. Check the remote gateway and SSH stability. |
| A pane vanished from the warm set but its switcher entry is still there | It was LRU-evicted (warm set full). The tunnel is untouched: selecting the crew re-warms it, though the re-mint plus SPA cold boot makes that look like a reconnect. Only an explicit `instances.warm_set_cap`, or a fleet past the automatic ceiling (`WARM_SET_CAP_AUTO_CEILING`), can now be below the number of registered crews — set it to `0` to let the cap track the registry. |
| Every token mint fails on one remote, though its gateway is healthy | The remote's `~/.local/bin/kirocrew` probably points at an uninstalled checkout. See §12: the run-marker is what makes mint follow the *running* gateway's install. |

---

## 11. Input validation (`validation.py`)

`instances/validation.py` is the **authoritative** injection guard for the two
user-controlled strings that reach an `ssh` command line. It lives next to the
tunnel manager rather than in the registry on purpose: the registry's
`_SSH_HOST_RE` / `_REMOTE_BIN_RE` checks are an *early reject* for obviously
malformed input at add/update time, while these functions run immediately before
each command line is built, which is the only point where the value is actually
dangerous. That ordering matters because the registry's load path
(`Instance.from_dict`) is deliberately tolerant and does **not** validate, so a
hand-edited or hand-migrated `instances.json` can hold anything at all until one
of these functions sees it.

Two distinct attacks, two distinct rules:

- `validate_ssh_host()` closes **ssh option injection**. Even with no local
  shell, an `ssh_host` like `-oProxyCommand=...` is parsed by ssh as an *option*
  and can run an arbitrary local command. It therefore rejects an empty value,
  anything over 255 chars, more than one `@`, an empty user or host segment, any
  segment beginning with `-`, and any character outside
  `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` (with the segment required to start with a letter, digit or
  underscore). It returns the stripped host so callers use the validated form.
- `validate_remote_bin()` closes **remote shell injection**. `remote_bin` is
  embedded, double-quoted, into the single command string the *remote* shell
  evaluates, so it forbids every shell metacharacter, `$` included (no command
  substitution or expansion the gateway does not control), and bounds the value
  to 512 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9._/~ -]`. An empty string is legal and means "use
  the candidate search".

Failures raise `SshValidationError` (a `ValueError`).

Where it is called, and what each caller does with a rejection:

| Caller | Behavior on rejection |
|--------|----------------------|
| `SshTunnelManager.connect()` | Returns an ERROR status carrying "invalid ssh settings", retained in `_last_error` so the switcher entry can explain itself. |
| `SshTunnelManager._recover()` | Aborts self-heal for that instance with a warning (no point retrying an unusable record). |
| `SshTunnelManager._refresh_token_once()` | Aborts the refresh with a warning. |
| `SshTunnelManager.restart_remote()` | Returns `{ok: false, message: "invalid ssh settings: ..."}`. |
| `diagnostics.diagnose_instance()` | Short-circuits to an `unknown` diagnosis with a clear reason, **before** spawning any `ssh`. |

The remaining variable parts of the remote command are bounded by their own
validators in `token_mint.py`: `_validate_ttl` (`<1-4 digits>[hm]`) and
`_validate_port` (an int in 1-65535). The bin candidates and the data-home path
segments are trusted module constants.

---

## 12. The gateway run-marker (`run_marker.py`)

`instances/run_marker.py` writes and reads
`<data-home>/run/gateway-<port>.bin` (the running gateway's own `kirocrew`
launcher path), `<data-home>/run/gateway-<port>.pid` (its pid) and
`<data-home>/run/gateway-<port>.start` (that pid's start-time identity, section
12.2). It has two unrelated consumers, and separating them is the point of the
module.

### Consumer 1: remote token mint targets the running gateway's install

Token mint SSHes to the remote and resolves `kirocrew` from a fixed PATH
candidate list whose first entry is `$HOME/.local/bin/kirocrew`. When that
launcher symlinks into an *uninstalled* checkout (no `.venv`), every mint fails
even though the gateway itself is healthy, because the gateway runs from a
different venv. Rebuilding and restarting the gateway does not fix mint, since
mint never consults the gateway's own install, and the refresh loop then fails on
every cycle, which surfaces to the user as a pane that periodically disconnects
and reconnects.

The fix: at startup the gateway records the absolute path to *its own* launcher,
keyed by the port it serves. The mint shell snippet reads that marker first and,
when it names an executable file, `exec`s it, so mint uses the same venv as the
live gateway. The snippet probes three data homes in priority order, since the
remote's non-interactive SSH shell usually does not export `KIROCREW_HOME`:

1. `$KIROCREW_HOME` when set and non-empty,
2. `$HOME/<CONFIG_DIR_NAME>` (the current default, `.kiro/crew`),
3. `$HOME/<LEGACY_CONFIG_DIR_NAME>` (`.kirocrew`, for a not-yet-migrated remote).

Those two home segments are **interpolated from the shared
`kiro_crew.config.paths` constants**, the same ones the marker *writer* derives
its default from, so reader and writer cannot drift apart on a future data-home
rename. An absent or stale marker, or one that does not name an executable, falls
through to the candidate search, so nothing regresses on an older remote. An
explicit `remote_bin` is never overridden by the marker: it is the user's
deliberate choice.

`restart_remote()` resolves `kirocrew restart` through the same path, keyed by
the instance's `remote_port`.

The launcher path is derived from `sys.executable`'s sibling console script
(`kirocrew`, or `kirocrew.exe` on Windows) and is deliberately **not** resolved
through symlinks, because the console script sits next to the possibly-symlinked
interpreter in the venv's `bin/`, not next to the real interpreter. When no such
script exists (a source-tree `python -m kiro_crew` launch) the marker is written
**empty**: the mint clause requires a non-empty executable path so an empty
marker is inert there, but the *filename* still matters to consumer 2.

### Consumer 2: zero-config client port discovery

The marker's filename advertises which port a gateway serves, so `marker_ports()`
lets a local client command (`token` / `status` / `logout` / `stop`, via
`port_resolution.resolve_client_port`) find a gateway on a non-default port with no
configuration. That path reads only the filename and ignores marker *contents*
entirely. Resolution order is `--port`, then `KIROCREW_PORT`, then a port named
by `dashboard.url`, then the sole gateway-owned marker, then the default 5476.

**A marker is not proof a gateway is there.** `clear_marker()` runs only on
graceful shutdown, so a crash or SIGKILL leaves the file behind and an unrelated
process may since have bound that port. Because client commands send the local
secret (`X-Local-Secret`) to whatever answers, the consumer must verify the
listener before trusting a discovered port. `port_resolution._gateway_owns_port()`
does that in four fail-closed steps: the recorded pid must exist, must be among
`platform_compat.find_listening_pids(port)`, must be owned by the caller's uid
(which closes pid recycling into another user's process), and must look like a
gateway by argv (defense in depth only, never the sole proof). Discovery is
skipped outright on non-POSIX hosts, where no owner can be reported and the
file-permission argument does not hold, so Windows users keep `--port` /
`KIROCREW_PORT`. This module deliberately offers no bare "is something
listening" helper, so no caller can mistake reachability for identity.

The live gateway prunes markers naming other ports on startup, EXCEPT any whose
gateway passes the same ownership proof its readers use. `gateway.lock` makes a
gateway a singleton per data home only when every start goes through it, and in
practice one machine runs several that share a home (a second gateway launched by
hand, one started from another checkout that inherits the default data home, a
cutover overlapping its predecessor). A blanket prune deletes a LIVE gateway's
marker and pid sidecar, which makes it undiscoverable to `token` / `status` /
`stop` and destroys the evidence section 12.1 depends on. The ownership check fails
closed by RETURNING FALSE rather than raising -- non-POSIX returns False outright,
and a missing or throwing listener-lookup tool is folded into False as well -- so a
False answer means "ownership not proven", NOT "process gone", and the two cases are
indistinguishable from the caller. Such a marker still prunes, so markers do not
accumulate forever -- but the prune removes only the marker and pid sidecar, never
the credential, because treating False as death would strip a LIVE incumbent's
credential on every Windows host and push its clients onto a shared file a newcomer
may have replaced. `clear_marker()` owns credential deletion.

### 12.1 The internal-API credential is keyed by port

`<data-home>/run/gateway-<port>.secret` holds the internal-API credential of the
gateway serving that port, written `0600` beside the marker and removed by
`clear_marker()` with it.

The credential is generated per gateway start (`os.urandom(16).hex()`) and kept in
memory as the value the auth middleware compares against, so it identifies ONE
generation. Published only to the single shared `<data-home>/.local_secret`, it
was last-writer-wins per home: a second gateway starting in the same home replaced
the file while the first kept serving the port, the incumbent went on comparing
against its own in-memory value, and every internal caller then sent the
newcomer's credential to the incumbent. The whole internal channel answers 403
with a body of exactly `Forbidden` until one of them restarts: `learn_add`,
`spawn`, `session-keepalive`, artifact writes, the task runner, all at once, with
no warning and no metric.

Two rules keep the two halves paired:

- **The writer** (`dashboard.server._write_instance_credentials`) always writes the
  per-port file, and writes the shared `.local_secret` only when no other gateway
  in the home is verifiably alive on a different port. The shared file is still
  written in the single-instance case because pre-per-port readers (an older CLI,
  a cron script from a previous install) know only that path.
- **The reader** is ONE shared helper, `config.loader.read_local_secret(port)`: it
  returns the credential for the port the caller is about to dial and falls back to
  `.local_secret` when no per-port file exists. It lives there rather than in each
  reader because every surface that implements its own read reintroduces the bug for
  itself. **`port` is required.** An optional port would resolve the dial target from
  process context, so a converted call site could read the credential for one gateway
  while dialing another -- the same desync, reintroduced one call site at a time and
  invisible in the hunk under review. A caller with no port resolves one explicitly
  and passes it, where the choice is reviewable. `mcp_core`, `mcp_shared`,
  `cron_script`, `computer_use/screencast` and the Sage review driver each name their
  dial target; a test greps for a no-argument call so the shape cannot come back.
- **The dialed port's own credential outranks any path a caller names.**
  `cron_trigger.trigger_cron_job` reads the per-port credential for the port it posts
  to FIRST, and falls back to the `secret_path` its caller named only when that is
  absent. The order is deliberate and is dictated by the callers: both of them pass
  `config_dir() / ".local_secret"`, the home-wide file, which is exactly the file a
  second gateway generation replaces -- so preferring the named path would reinstate
  the defect this module exists to prevent.
  The cost of that order, stated rather than hidden: a crash-orphaned
  `run/gateway-<port>.secret` (the prune never deletes credentials, see section 12)
  is preferred over a correct named path, so a caller that genuinely names another
  home's credential for a port this home once served would send the stale one and get
  a 403. No caller does that today -- both name the ambient home-wide file -- and
  closing it properly means the credential-path parameter going away rather than the
  order flipping.

A denial carries a machine-readable `code` (`internal_auth_mismatch`) beside the
prose, because a genuine permission denial produces the same `Forbidden` body and a
consumer matching on text misdiagnoses one as the other. It also names both sides by
fingerprint (a short SHA-256 prefix plus length, never the value), so a
cross-generation mismatch is distinguishable from a forged header and from a caller
that had no credential at all; without it a real desync is unattributable from the
log.

### Why `run/` is on the sensitive-path floor

The marker names a path that the gateway `exec`s on the remote host **outside**
the agent sandbox, and `run/` also holds the sandbox launcher scripts. An agent
that could write into this dir could point a marker at an attacker-controlled
binary and get it executed unsandboxed on the next routine token refresh: a
reachable sandbox escape, which the owner and `-x` checks do not stop because
agent writes run as the same user. `run/` is therefore classified read+write
sensitive in `security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`, under every known data-home prefix.
The dir is created `0700` (re-applied on an existing dir, since `exist_ok` does
not re-apply mode) and every file is written `0600` through the shared
`atomic_write` helper, whose unique `mkstemp` + `os.replace` closes the
same-user symlink TOCTOU a predictable `<name>.tmp` would leave open. Every
legitimate writer opens these paths directly and does not route through the file
gate, so gateway startup and spawn are unaffected.

### 12.2 The pid's start identity is a separate sidecar

`<data-home>/run/gateway-<port>.start` holds the start-time identity of the
process named by `gateway-<port>.pid`. `run_marker.pid_start_token()` is its single
producer and it CHAINS two platform helpers, because neither covers every host and
using either alone costs a platform:

- `platform_compat.get_process_start_id()` is preferred — the same producer session
  PIDs use, in-process (no subprocess), and microsecond resolution on macOS, where
  `process_start_time`'s `ps -o lstart=` spelling is only 1-second granular, so a
  PID recycled inside the same second would reproduce an identical value.
- `platform_compat.process_start_time()` is the fallback, and it is what keeps
  **Windows** working: it reads the process creation `FILETIME` (100-ns units)
  through a query-only handle, while `get_process_start_id()` implements Linux and
  macOS only and answers `None` everywhere else. Without this leg the token is
  empty on every Windows host, so a pod there could never prove ownership — an
  unsatisfiable requirement rather than a strict one. `metrics.md` records the same
  trap reached from the other direction: `get_process_start_id` used alone as a
  liveness test "judged every owner dead on that entire platform".

The fallback's value is whitespace-collapsed, because the macOS `ps` spelling is
space-padded and the reader requires a single token; Windows returns a bare
integer, so the collapse is a no-op there.

It is a **separate file, not a second line in the pid sidecar**. The reader
shipped in every released client takes the WHOLE pid file, strips it and requires
`isdigit()`, so a two-line record reads as `None` — and an older client venv
sharing this data home would then have `_gateway_owns_port()` deny a gateway that
genuinely is ours. `_pid_record()` therefore stays byte-identical to the
historical `<pid>\n`, and `read_pid_record_path()` returns `(pid, start_token)` by
reading the pid from the path it was given and the token from the `.start` sibling
beside it. `write_marker()` writes `.start` first (both orders fail closed; this
one narrows the window in which a published pid has no identity), writes it even
when empty so a predecessor's token can never be left in place, and both
`prune_markers()` and `clear_marker()` remove it with the pid it attests.

An absent, oversized, non-ASCII or whitespace-bearing `.start` file all read as
`""` = **unproven**, never as a wildcard match: `pod.runtime._pod_recorded_pid()`
re-probes the live identity and refuses unless it agrees verbatim, which is what
lets a PID-record/`MainPID` agreement attest with no listener evidence at all. A
record with no identity is refused for a *different reason* than a stale one, and
the two need opposite remedies — a crash leftover is fixed by a restart, while a
missing identity means the pod's checkout predates this sidecar, so its worktree
must be rebuilt and re-provisioned. `pod.runtime._unproven_remedy()` splits them,
because a refusal that prescribes a restart which cannot work sends an agent
round a loop that never terminates.

---

## 13. The SSM connection method (`connection_method`)

Each instance record carries a `connection_method`: `"ssh"` (default) or `"ssm"`.
SSM tunnels over AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, so it needs no inbound
port, no sshd and no distributed key — reachability is an IAM decision
(`ssm:StartSession` on the instance ARN) rather than a network one.

| Method | Tunnel command | Client prerequisites | Mint path |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| `ssh` (default) | `ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:LP:127.0.0.1:RP <ssh_host>` | non-interactive SSH access | `ssh <host> kirocrew token` |
| `ssm` | `aws ssm start-session --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession --target <ssm_target> --parameters portNumber=RP,localPortNumber=LP` | AWS CLI + `session-manager-plugin`; `ssm:StartSession`, `ssm:SendCommand`, `ssm:GetCommandInvocation` | `aws ssm send-command` → `kirocrew token` |

Records are back-compatible: an `instances.json` written before this feature has
no `connection_method` and loads as `"ssh"`.

SSM-only registry fields: `ssm_target` (an EC2 `i-…` or SSM managed-instance
`mi-…` id), plus optional `aws_profile`, `aws_region` and `ssm_run_as`. Only the
profile **name** is persisted — never a credential; the AWS CLI resolves
credentials via its own provider chain.

`ssm_run_as` is the **remote POSIX user** SSM commands run as: `cloud.ssm.run_command`
wraps every remote command in `sudo -u <user> -i bash`, and its default
(`ec2-user`) is a *launcher* assumption that holds only for provisioned AL2023
boxes. Without a per-instance override, an Ubuntu AMI would bring the tunnel up
and then fail the mint — and, because the readiness probe also runs through that
same wrapper, `diagnose_instance_ssm` would report `remote_down` for a perfectly
healthy remote gateway. The field defaults to `ec2-user` (so existing records and
launcher-provisioned boxes are unaffected), is charset-validated as a Unix
username like the other SSM coordinates, and an empty value resolves to the
default rather than emitting a bare `sudo -u ''`.

### One state machine, two transports

`_SshTunnel` builds either argv from the same class, and `_TransportParams`
(resolved once per operation by `_resolve_transport`) carries the validated
per-transport values so `connect` / `_rebuild` / `_recover` /
`_refresh_token_once` / `restart_remote` share one code path. The health probe,
2-tier self-heal, proactive refresh, stored-token liveness probe and startup
auto-revive are transport-agnostic.

Two SSM-specific behaviours:

- **Process-tree teardown (all platforms).** The SSM child gets process-group
  isolation at spawn — `start_new_session` on POSIX, `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`
  on Windows, passed explicitly per the `platform_compat` recipe — and teardown
  reaps the whole tree through `platform_compat.kill_process_tree` (`killpg`
  POSIX / `taskkill /T` Windows). This matters because the
  `session-manager-plugin` grandchild is what actually holds the forwarded port:
  `terminate()` on the `aws` wrapper alone orphans it and wedges the port. Doing
  this with raw `os.killpg`/`os.getpgid` would silently degrade to
  wrapper-only termination on Windows, which Kiro Crew supports.
- **Readiness timeout.** `session-manager-plugin` completes a WebSocket handshake
  with the SSM service before binding, so the SSM transport uses a longer default
  connect timeout than a direct ssh TCP connect. An explicit caller-supplied
  timeout still wins for both.

`_ssm_exit_error` classifies the child's exit with SSM vocabulary (expired
credentials, `ssm:StartSession` denial, missing plugin, target not a connected
managed node, local bind conflict) rather than running SSM stderr through the ssh
auth/transport matchers, which would mislabel an `AccessDenied` as an ssh auth
failure.

### Diagnosis ladder

`diagnose_instance_ssm` mirrors the SSH ladder with an SSM first rung, so an
offline agent is not reported as a dead remote gateway:

1. managed node online? (`describe-instance-information`) → no ⇒ `ssm_unreachable`
2. remote dashboard up? (`send-command` + curl on the remote loopback) → no ⇒ `remote_down`
3. local forward reachable? → no ⇒ `tunnel_down`, else `ok`

`ssm_unreachable` is a new diagnosis code; the shared rungs reuse SSM-worded
reasons so the copy never tells an SSM user to "check SSH access".

### Reuse of the launcher's SSM primitives

Argv building and remote execution delegate to `cloud.ssm`
(`build_port_forward_argv`, `run_command`) rather than duplicating them, so the
two features cannot drift on the SSM document or parameter shape. Those calls run
in the gateway process, which has no `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`, so the launcher's
agent-session chokepoint does not apply; the `hooks.py` denied-command list gates
agent *tool* calls and likewise does not gate the gateway's own children.

### Trade-off: the mint transits SSM command history

The mint runs over `send-command`, so the token appears in that invocation's
output, which SSM retains for up to 30 days and is readable with
`ssm:GetCommandInvocation`. It is **not** in CloudTrail (which records the API
call, not the output), and no S3/CloudWatch output destination is configured.

Bounded by: the token is TTL-capped and only usable against the remote's
loopback, so *using* it requires `ssm:StartSession` — a superset of the access
needed to read the history. The generated launcher policy also withholds
`ssm:ListCommandInvocations`, so a holder cannot enumerate command ids hunting
for tokens. The SSH transport has no equivalent exposure. This mirrors the
accepted posture in `cloud/connect.py::mint_token`.

`ssm_token_mint.py` is listed in `security_posture.NON_EGRESS_REDACTION_MODULES`
alongside its SSH sibling: it redacts remote output on the way into an exception,
which is not an egress boundary.

### Interaction with §9

§9 documents reaching an SSM-only instance through an `~/.ssh/config`
`ProxyCommand` — still valid as a manual option, and still `connection_method="ssh"`:
the reachability lives in ssh config and Kiro Crew is unaware of it.
`connection_method="ssm"` is the direct alternative, requiring neither sshd nor a
key on the remote — and it is now what `cloud/connect.py`'s registry integration
uses (`register_instance` sets `connection_method="ssm"`, `ssm_target=<instance-id>`).
The legacy `ssm_proxy_ssh_host` helper is kept for reference only.

## 14. Session transfer (send a session to another instance)

Copies one dashboard session from this instance to a connected peer. The user
picks it from any session menu: **Send a copy to ▸ `<instance>`**.

Code: `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/session_transfer.py` (bundle + importer),
`SshTunnelManager.send_session_bundle` (delivery),
`handlers_instances.api_instances_send_session` (control plane), and the frontend
`SendToInstanceSubmenu` mounted inside the shared `SessionActionsMenu`.

### 14.1 Why it needs no new transport

A session is a portable JSONL transcript (`<data-home>/sessions/<key>.jsonl`:
a metadata line then `{role, content, ts}` records) and the receiving side
already knows how to turn one into a live tab — that is what
`chat_persistence` does on every gateway restart. So a transfer reuses two
things that exist: the tunnel from §4 and the rehydrate path.

The gateway binds loopback unconditionally (`dashboard/urls.py:is_local_only`
always returns `True` in the public build), so an instance tunnel is the only
sanctioned way to reach a peer. Nothing here opens a socket.

### 14.1a Two layers — and why Layer B is what makes resume real

The transcript above is only the **display** copy (*Layer A*). The context the
model actually holds — the compaction/turn state, keyed by a kiro-cli session id
— lives in a **second store outside the crew home**:
`kiro_sessions_dir()/<sid>.json` + `<sid>.jsonl`, joined to a slot through
`session_map.json`. Call it *Layer B*.

This split is the whole fidelity story. Ship Layer A alone and the peer has a
browsable history but no resumable context: `SessionMap.get` finds no usable sid
and the next turn falls back to `_build_history_prefix()`, a condensed ~8K-char
text prefix — no tool state, no real context window. Ship Layer B too and the
peer resumes through `session/load` under its own fresh sid, which is the same
fidelity a local gateway restart gives.

So `bundle_version` 2 carries an optional `layer_b`. It is **optional by
design**: a v1 sender, or a session that never opened a kiro-cli context, ships
Layer A only and the peer degrades to the prefix. Both versions stay accepted so
a newer instance can still receive from an older one.

On import Layer B's **host-naming fields** are rewritten — a fresh `sid`
(so copy-never-move holds and a repeat send cannot collide), `cwd` and the
filesystem `allowed_*_paths` cleared (matching the `project` decision below —
the session arrives unscoped), `agent_name` set to the target-resolved agent —
while the **conversation payload travels byte-exact**. That distinction is
forced, not stylistic: thinking blocks inside `conversation_metadata` carry a
provider `signature` over their own content, which is validated when the
conversation is replayed, so rewriting any covered byte makes the peer's *next
turn* fail — long after the import reported success. An earlier revision scrubbed
Layer B on both boundaries and, measured against one developer machine's 704 real
sessions, altered a signature in **41%** of them. Redacting this artifact and
transplanting it cannot both hold; what bounds the exposure is the destination
(the operator's own peer, over a tunnel they authenticated, stored `0600`), not a
scrub of the payload. **Layer A keeps its redaction** — that text is rendered and
re-read as context. Inbound Layer B is validated structurally (parse-only, never
rewritten) and refused whole if any record fails to parse. Materialisation is
**best-effort**: if it fails, the import still succeeds as the transcript-only
copy rather than failing an already-persisted session.

Sub-agent conversations deliberately do **not** travel. Their results were
already injected into the parent conversation, so they are inside Layer B
already; only `spawn_continue` against one specific sub-agent is lost on the
peer.

### 14.2 Copy, never move

Import **always allocates a new slot key** and never mutates or deletes an
existing session, on either side. Consequences worth stating:

- the source tab is untouched, so a failed transfer costs nothing;
- a repeat click sends a second copy rather than erroring, so the action needs
  no confirm step and no idempotency key;
- there is no "move" verb and nothing in this feature can destroy a
  conversation.

### 14.3 What travels, and what deliberately does not

| Field | Travels? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| transcript (`user` / `assistant` turns) | yes | Layer A — the portable display copy. Tool and system frames are dropped from it: they reference local tool state. |
| **`layer_b`** (kiro-cli context: envelope + events) | **yes (v2)** | Layer B — the real context window, so the session RESUMES rather than replaying a lossy ~8K prefix. Only host-naming fields are rewritten on arrival (fresh `sid`, cleared `cwd`/`allowed_*_paths`, target agent); the conversation payload travels **byte-exact and unredacted**, because its thinking-block signatures are validated on replay. Optional, and best-effort on import. |
| sub-agent conversations | no | Their results are already inside Layer B as injected context. Only `spawn_continue` on one specific sub-agent is lost. |
| memory (preferences, semantic KV, lessons) | no | A workspace's memory is a per-instance scope, and copying it across hosts is the risky, hard-to-undo part of a transfer. The peer keeps its own. |
| `title` | yes | Prefixed `⇄ ` and suffixed `(from <origin>)` on arrival, so a transferred tab is never mistaken for a locally-born one. The prefix is stripped before re-bundling so a session bounced back and forth does not accumulate one prefix per hop. |
| `agent` | hint only | Applied only if the target has an agent by that name, else dropped. An agent template is a local object; carrying the name blindly would leave the slot pointing at nothing. |
| **`project`** | **no** | The headline decision. The source's checkout path almost never exists on the target (a Mac worktree path on a Linux dev desk), and a slot pointing at a missing directory scopes file search and steering to nothing. The session arrives **unscoped** and the user re-picks a project. |
| `model` | no | Accounts differ in entitlement, so an id the source is served can fail at runtime on the target. The target resolves its own default ([model-selection](../common/model-selection.md)). |
| `workspace` | no | Workspaces are per-instance memory scopes; a matching name still means a different memory. |
| `folder_id`, `tags`, `tags_revision`, `pinned`, `artifact`, `app`, `linked_session_key`, `forked_from` | no | Local-graph references that would dangle (`tags_revision` is the per-instance change identity of `tags`; it travels with them). |

`bundle_version` is refused when **outside the supported set** (`{1, 2}`) rather
than best-effort parsed: the two ends are independently-updated installs, and a
silently misread field would land as corrupted conversation. Accepting both
versions is what lets a v2 instance still receive a copy from a v1 one.

### 14.4 API

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/instances/{id}/send-session` | Sending side. Body `{"slot": "<local slot key>"}`. Bundles the local session and delivers it over that instance's open tunnel. |
| `GET /api/chat/slots/{slot}/export` | Sending side, file hop. Streams the SAME bundle as a gzipped download instead of over a tunnel — see §14.7. |
| `POST /api/chat/slots/import` | Receiving side, for BOTH arrival routes. Accepts a bundle — gzipped or plain JSON, sniffed from its own bytes — and materialises a new slot. See §14.5a. |

`send-session` goes through the same `_guard()` as every other route in §6
(owner-only, never Slack, feature-gated, SEL-audited as
`instances_send_session`). It returns `{ok, instance, remote_key, messages}`.

Status codes: `404` unknown instance or unknown local slot, `400` a
non-persistent source session or a malformed body, `503` the manager is not
running or the source could not be persisted first, `502` the peer refused or
was unreachable (the peer's own `code` is forwarded).

**`send-session` is NOT a third token-crossing route.** §6's invariant holds:
`connect` and `refresh-token` remain the only two routes whose response carries a
minted token. The chat proxy cannot become a third one in-band either: its
allowlist (§6) forwards only the peer's `api/chat` and `api/stream` surfaces —
neither of which mints anything — so the peer's own token-minting routes are
unreachable through it. That is a property of the allowlist, so it must be
re-checked whenever a prefix is added: a new row that reached a minting route
would make the proxy a third token-crossing route without touching this file.
The transfer needs the
credential but the browser does not, so the
request is issued **inside `SshTunnelManager.send_session_bundle`** — the token
never leaves the manager, is sent as a cookie (so it cannot land in the peer's
access log), and is never logged. Any audit of where tokens leave the gateway
still finds exactly two routes.

### 14.5 Trust model for an inbound session

An imported transcript is untrusted input that later becomes context an agent
re-reads, so:

- reaching `/api/chat/slots/import` requires a valid dashboard credential, which
  in practice means a token this hub minted on that host — a peer cannot push a
  session into an instance it has no credential for;
- bundles are size-bounded before anything is written (5,000 messages, 1 MB per
  message, 20 MB of content total) and every message's role is checked against
  `user`/`assistant`;
- assistant content is credential- and exfiltration-redacted on the way in,
  matching the fork path. User turns are left verbatim: redacting what the human
  typed would corrupt their own words;
- **import does not drive a turn.** The session lands as a tab and waits for the
  user to type. This is the feature's main security advantage over an
  agent-facing "send a message to a peer" tool: no inbound text can make a
  remote agent act.

### 14.5a Arrival: one route, one set of rules

`POST /api/chat/slots/import` is the **only** server route behind both ways a
session can arrive — a peer's `send_session_bundle` pushing over the tunnel, and
a person importing an exported file from `ImportSessionItem`. So everything
that must hold for "a session arrived here" is written in `api_chat_slot_import`
and nowhere else. Two rules live there.

**The body is gzip or plain JSON, decided by its own first two bytes.** Not by
`Content-Type`: `GET .../export` answers `application/gzip`, a browser uploading
that same file off disk sends whatever its platform guesses, and the tunnel sends
`application/json` — sniffing the magic (`1f 8b`) keeps all three working without
asking any caller to relabel what it already sends. The tunnel's plain-JSON body
is unchanged on purpose: the sender is an independently-updated install, so a
receiver that started demanding compression would refuse every peer that has not
shipped this yet.

A compressed upload is an amplifier, so the expansion is bounded **while it is
being produced** rather than measured afterwards — `_gunzip_bounded` decompresses
in chunks and refuses at `_MAX_DECOMPRESSED_BYTES`, holding at most one chunk
past the cap.

What makes that ceiling safe is the comparison to the gateway's own body limit,
not the arithmetic behind it. `client_max_size` is 60 MiB and applies to every
body, compressed or not, so the PLAIN path can never deliver more than that much
JSON; the ceiling sits above it, which means the gzip path accepts strictly more
than the plain path can and a body it refuses is one the plain path refuses too.
The magnitude is taken from §14.5's own ceilings
(`_MAX_TOTAL_CHARS + _MAX_LAYER_B_CHARS` plus a structural allowance) so the
number moves with them, but it is deliberately NOT the worst-case ENCODED width:
those ceilings count CHARACTERS and `ensure_ascii` renders one non-ASCII
character as six bytes, so sizing for that case would admit a ~360 MB allocation
on an authenticated write route to accommodate a bundle `client_max_size` already
refuses.

The per-body ceiling bounds ONE request; the sum across concurrent requests is
what reaches a host, so expansion is also ADMITTED rather than merely started.
`_expansion_admission` caps how many bodies expand at once and keeps a short
queue in front; anything past the queue answers `429 transfer_expansion_busy`
immediately rather than parking, because a queue that grows without limit is the
same failure with a delay in front of it.

A permit is held for the whole ARRIVAL, not for the decompression: it is entered
on an `AsyncExitStack` the handler owns, which is why the arrival is a separate
function from the route. What has to be bounded is how many decompressed bundles
are RESIDENT at once, and a bundle is resident — first as bytes, then as the
parsed document — through validation, redaction and persistence. A permit ending
at the gunzip would bound the CPU of expansion while leaving that count
unbounded, which is the sum the admission exists to bound; the cost is
throughput, since concurrent importers now reach the queue sooner. The plain-JSON
path takes no permit: it is bounded by the Application's own `client_max_size`
(60 MiB) and is not amplified, so a peer posting uncompressed cannot be refused
with `429` by a busy host.

A corrupt or truncated stream answers `transfer_invalid_gzip`, distinct from
`transfer_invalid_json`, because "your file did not survive the trip" and "your
document has a syntax error" send a reader to different places. A concatenated
(multi-member) gzip is refused rather than decoded to its first member: the
export writes exactly one member, so decoding one and dropping the rest would be
a truncation nobody asked for.

**The session is filed under `Imported` / `from <sender>`.** The second rule, and
the reason it lives beside the first: a gzipped file arriving from a person and a
plain-JSON bundle arriving over the tunnel are the same event carried by different
transport, so the encoding must decide neither how the bytes are read nor where
the session lands. `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/arrival_folders.py` owns it; the
decision record, including why the tunnel's previously-unfiled default was
changed, is
[rfc-arrival-provenance-filing.md](../../request-for-change/rfc-arrival-provenance-filing.md).

`<sender>` is the bundle's redacted `origin`. It names a folder and confers
nothing: `origin` is a field of an untrusted bundle, so it is never read as an
identity. A bundle with no `origin` is filed under `Imported` directly rather than
under an invented "from unknown". The names are ASCII English literals, because a
folder created here is an ordinary sidebar row a person can rename, and a name
re-derived per render from the active locale would fight that rename.

Four properties make the filing safe to run on an authenticated write route:

- **An app-scoped arrival creates no folder and adopts none**, so it lands
  unfiled. The folder store has a global ceiling (`MAX_CHAT_FOLDERS`), and an app
  token that could create a folder per arrival could loop imports with distinct
  `origin` values until the person is refused a folder of their own. The identity
  is the caller's, from the shared `effective_request_app` rule — never from the
  body.
- **Placement is resolved only after the slot exists**, as the last `await` before
  the durable save. The handler re-checks the live-slot cap after its own last
  `await` and can answer `429` there, and a folder written in front of that check
  is left behind when it fires.
- **Find-or-create is atomic across both levels**, inside one `mutate_folders`
  transaction — the shape `ensure_channel_folder` already uses (§ chat folders) —
  so two arrivals from one peer cannot each create a folder with the same name,
  and a delete of `Imported` cannot land between the two appends. The lookup
  compares the name the store WRITES (trimmed and clipped to 100 characters), or a
  long sender name would miss the clipped row a previous arrival wrote.
- **Filing is best-effort, and a mid-import delete is repaired.** A ceiling
  refusal or a store write failure lands the session unfiled rather than failing
  an import that would otherwise work. The folder is re-checked immediately before
  the durable save and again after the slot is re-registered in `state._slots`:
  for the whole finalisation stretch the slot is retracted from that mapping,
  which is what the folder delete handler's unfile sweep iterates, so without the
  second check a delete in that window would leave a dangling `folder_id`.
  The repair writes only while `state._slots` still holds that slot OBJECT. A
  close landing inside the folder-existence await pops the slot and then persists
  `closed=True`, so an unguarded repair would write the imported object's
  `closed=False` over it and resurface the tab the person dismissed; the repair is
  skipped instead, which leaves a dangling `folder_id` on the archived record —
  the state the folder delete handler already documents as ignored on the next
  load. The condition is deliberately the opposite polarity to
  `chat_handlers._slot_still_ours`, which counts an absent key as still ours
  because a close pops before its own teardown.
  Best-effort covers the FOLDER, never the transcript: before the handler reports
  success, one delete witness runs on EVERY path, and a session deleted while the
  import was finishing is rolled back with a `409` rather
  than reported as landed. Two distinct witnesses reach that one refusal. The
  repair's own save returns a clean `False` — not an exception — when the
  delete-won guard fires; and because a save reporting success does not imply that
  guard decided anything (best-effort converts a raising save to success), the
  import also asks `session_was_deleted` unconditionally afterwards. Without that
  second, unconditional check the common case is unguarded: a `DELETE` landing in
  the folder-existence await removes the transcript while the folder it points at
  is still fine, so the repair branch is skipped entirely and the handler would
  answer `200 ok` for data that no longer exists. Nothing re-arms after either
  witness, so reporting the import as landed would be a success no later flush
  ever corrects. Nothing awaits between that unconditional check and the response,
  which is the second half of the invariant and why the arrival-row mark below
  sits above it: any await in that gap reopens the window the check closes,
  because the `DELETE` lands inside the await and the check has already passed.
- **A failed import takes back the folders it created.** The row is committed
  before the transcript's durable save, and nothing reclaims an empty chat folder
  afterwards, so every later failure path passes the rows the filing reports in
  `ArrivalFiling.created_rows` to `discard_arrival_folders`. Only rows the filing
  CREATED, never one it adopted: adopting means the person already owned that row.
  Four guards, all inside the one transaction so no answer can go
  stale: a row any LIVE slot is filed into is left alone, because a concurrent
  arrival or a person's move can have filled it; a row whose child survives is
  left alone, because removing it would orphan that child; a row carrying the
  `arrival_adopted` marker is left alone, because a later arrival has filed into
  it; and a row the PERSON has edited is left alone, because none of the first
  three can see an edit. A rename, colour, icon, tag, project directory, default
  agent or move files no session into the row, writes no marker and leaves no
  child, so all three earlier guards pass and the edit would be deleted with the
  row. The window is the whole finalization tail rather than one failing save: the
  last of the three rollback call sites is the delete-witness refusal, past the
  transcript save, the folder-existence await and the shared-row mark, so a row is
  already visible in the sidebar while it can still be reclaimed. The comparison
  is against the record the RESOLVER wrote — carried in `created_rows` as
  `(id, name, parent_id)`, not stamped on the row — so a surviving row's record
  stays identical to a hand-made folder's and a successful import leaves no
  bookkeeping in the store. Content fields (`name`, `parent_id`, `project_dir`,
  `default_agent`) plus the presence of any key a created row never carries
  (`color`, `icon`, `tags`, `owner_app`) count as an edit; `order`, `collapsed` and
  `hidden` are sidebar position and view state and do not, because they carry
  nothing a person loses when an EMPTY auto-created row is removed. A case-only
  rename counts as an edit even though `_find` deliberately treats it as the same
  folder, because lookup wants those to be one row and deletion wants to know the
  person touched this one. The marker exists because the live-slot read cannot see an ARCHIVED session
  — it is popped out of `state._slots` — so a row an archived session is filed
  into looks unoccupied and has no surviving child. It is written on the LANDED
  path (`mark_arrival_folder_shared`) rather than in the resolving transaction,
  and only for the destination
  the filing adopted: an adoption that never becomes a session needs no
  protection, and a mark written at adoption time could not be taken back, so two
  concurrent same-origin imports both failing their durable save left each
  other's rows marked and the pair leaked for good. Either way the rollback needs
  no scan of persisted sessions. That write sits immediately ABOVE the final
  witness, because it is the last await on the path: below the witness its await
  would yield the loop past the last check, so a `DELETE` landing inside it
  removes the transcript and pops the slot while the handler still answers
  `200 ok`, which is the identical window the witness exists to close. A second
  witness below the write buys the same guarantee and costs either an extra `stat`
  on every import that adopted nothing or a conditional witness, which is the case
  analysis the unconditional shape refuses. The ordering's cost is that one
  refusal can follow the mark: a delete landing in that await leaves the row
  marked while the import gives up, so the creating import's rollback can never
  reclaim it — one visible, deletable row, and only when the creating import also
  failed, which the next arrival from that origin adopts rather than duplicating.
  It is an optional key, the shape
  `create_folder_record`
  already uses for `color` and `owner_app`, and it is one-way: a row that has been
  shared is never reclaimed again, which errs toward leaving an empty row the
  person can delete rather than removing one somebody is filed into. That write
  REPORTS whether the row is marked, and the handler acts on the answer, because
  the mark is the only thing sparing an adopted row once the session archives out
  of the live-slot occupancy read. A write that raised, or a row already gone,
  reports unprotected; the handler then clears and persists the session's
  `folder_id` under the same slot-identity guard the filing repair uses, so the
  session is genuinely unfiled rather than left pointing at a row a concurrent
  creator's rollback can reclaim. Reporting rather than raising keeps filing from
  failing an import whose transcript has landed. The window
  the move opens is the sliver between the durable save and that write, during
  which the slot is retracted from `state._slots`: a creator's rollback landing
  there deletes the row, and the handler's own filing repair then renders the
  session at the top level — the outcome an unfiled arrival always had, and the
  same one a folder delete produces. The ids are walked in reverse
  (they are recorded parent-first), so the child is taken before its parent and
  the parent then satisfies the second guard on the same pass. The rollback never
  raises — the caller is already answering a failure, and a store error here would
  replace a precise coded refusal with a 500.

  This covers the durable-save `503`, the generic finalisation failure and both
  `409` refusals. It deliberately does NOT cover
  cancellation: that arm rolls back synchronously because awaiting inside a
  cancelled task is not dependable, while the folder store's lock is async. A
  shutdown or disconnect mid-import can still leave one empty row, which stays
  recoverable by hand because the row is an ordinary visible folder.
- **A refusal claims only what it achieved.** The transcript is persisted before
  the final witness runs, and that witness reports "deleted" for three different
  situations: the file is gone, the file belongs to a NEW incarnation, and
  existence is unverifiable. Only the first makes "nothing was kept" true, so the
  refusal reads the disk once through `session_transcript_remains` and answers
  `409 transfer_import_deleted` when nothing is left, or
  `409 transfer_import_deleted_partial` when a transcript remains. The remaining
  file is deliberately NOT unlinked: a new incarnation belongs to another session,
  and an unverifiable read names nothing that can safely be removed. That probe
  fails closed toward "something remains", because the dangerous direction is
  promising a clean slate that does not exist.

  Its key-scoped unwinding reads the slot table for THREE outcomes, not two,
  because `dict.get` answers `None` for an absent key exactly as it does for a
  replaced one. This object still holding the key: pop it, drop the Layer B join
  and remove the pair. A DIFFERENT object holding it: touch nothing, because the
  slot, the join and the files are that writer's. No object holding it, which is
  what the ordinary permanent delete leaves behind: drop the join and remove this
  import's OWN pair, since nobody else owns it and the delete does not unwind
  these module-local helpers. The last case is scoped to the sid this import
  already knows: the unlink targets that sid rather than the one the join reports,
  and the join is dropped only while it still NAMES that sid. An absent key is not
  evidence that the mapping at it is this import's — a replacement can register its
  own join and be popped again inside the same tail — and a forget by key alone
  would take that replacement's mapping and its continuable mark with nothing to
  re-arm, since this refusal return is terminal. `resumable_sid` and
  `forget_conversation` both resolve `_session_map.get` on the same folded key, so
  the guard reads the exact value the forget would report and delete, and both are
  synchronous with no await between them.

### 14.6 Direction and topology

The submenu on a given dashboard lists **that** gateway's registry, so a push
runs hub → peer. Because each remote dashboard is embedded as an iframe (§3), a
"send" driven from inside a remote pane would need that remote to reach back to
the hub — usually impossible (a dev desk cannot SSH to a laptop). Sending in the
other direction is therefore done by registering the peers you want on each host
that should originate a transfer, and a hub-initiated **pull** (read a peer's
session over the same forward) is the natural follow-on that would make
remote → hub and remote → remote work without any reverse reachability.

### 14.7 The file hop (`GET /api/chat/slots/{slot}/export`)

The same bundle, written to a file instead of pushed down a tunnel. Code:
`src/kiro_crew/dashboard/session_export.py`, with the menu action
`ExportSessionItem` mounted beside `SendToInstanceSubmenu` in the shared
`SessionActionsMenu`, and `ImportSessionItem` — the reverse direction — mounted
directly beside it, because the file this reads is the file that row writes.

**Why the hop exists.** §14.4's send is a request/response between two live
gateways, so it needs both machines up at the same moment, reachable from one
account, with a working tunnel between them. A laptop that is asleep can receive
nothing, and two machines that never see each other have no path at all. A file
needs none of that.

**It adds no format.** `bundle_version` stays **2**. The keys the export adds are
additive, which is what keeps §14.3's compatibility promise: `_validate_bundle`
refuses an unrecognised version outright but drops an unknown KEY silently, so a
version bump would stop every instance that has not updated from receiving
anything, while a new optional key costs it nothing.

The response is `application/gzip` with
`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''<percent-encoded name>` and
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. The name is `<title-slug>-<stamp>.kcsession.json.gz`.
The slug is script-PRESERVING — a CJK, Cyrillic or accented title keeps its
characters, because the header carries them percent-encoded, which is the spelling
every other download handler already ships (`handlers/files.py`,
`handlers/diagnostics.py`, `handlers/wakatime.py`). Percent-encoding is also what
makes the header injection-proof: a title cannot contribute a quote, a semicolon,
a CR or an LF.

Status codes: `404` unknown slot, a slot an app token does not own, or a
CHANNEL-LINKED slot named by an app token — all three answer the same code,
because a distinguishable 403 would let an app enumerate slots, or learn which of
its own slots carry a channel link, across the isolation boundary (CWE-204);
`400` an incognito or
temporary session (`export_slot_not_persistent`), one with no visible messages
(`export_bundle_empty`), or one whose bundle the importer itself would refuse
(`export_bundle_rejected`, carrying the importer's own code); `503` no consistent
view of the transcript could be taken (`export_snapshot_unstable`, retryable);
`500` any other assembly failure (`export_failed`). SEL-audited as
`chat.slot_export`.

**Owning the slot is not owning the transcript.** A channel-linked slot displays a
conversation that lives on the channel's own session, and `get_or_create_slot`
auto-binds that link from a channel-shaped slot NAME, which the creating caller
supplies. So an app can hold a slot it legitimately owns whose transcript belongs
to a channel it does not. An app token is therefore refused on any channel-linked
slot rather than the handler reasoning about the binding — fail closed, because
the cost of being wrong is a foreign conversation leaving the app sandbox. The
dashboard owner is unaffected, being entitled to both.

**A producer never emits a document its own reader would refuse.** Before
compressing, the handler runs the bundle through `_validate_bundle` — the
importer's own validator — and refuses the export if it would be rejected. The
bounds (5,000 messages, 1 MB per message, 20 MB of content) are therefore
consulted rather than restated, so the producer and the reader cannot drift apart.
Only the VERDICT is used: the validated payload is discarded, because validation
rebuilds a normalised allowlist that would strip the optional keys the export adds
on purpose.

Three properties worth stating because they are easy to lose:

- **Layer B leaves in an export only on an explicit operator opt-in, and is
  withheld by default.** An export CAN carry §14.1a's byte-exact, unredacted
  Layer B so an installed file RESUMES through `session/load` rather than
  replaying a lossy prefix. Byte-exact is forced, not chosen: the thinking-block
  signatures inside Layer B are validated on replay (§14.1a), so redacting and
  transplanting cannot both hold and there is no redacted variant. Because an
  export can be shared with another person, unredacted context must not ride
  along unasked: `rfc-s3-backup.md` O1 assigns that risk to the operator, not the
  exporter, and its minimum bar for a sensitive payload in a bundle is
  conjunctive (`rfc-s3-backup.md`:317-319) -- a config key OFF by default AND an
  explicit per-invocation flag. So Layer B travels only when BOTH
  `dashboard.export_include_layer_b` is enabled (standing permission, default
  `false`) AND the request carries `?include_layer_b=true` (this export asked).
  A default-on would ship the implementer's decision to everyone who never chose,
  the opposite of what O1 assigns, so the default withholds: the export sets
  `layer_b_skipped`, the loss is stated rather than inferred from an absent key,
  and the importer marks the arriving tab "transcript only". Layer B is also
  withheld with the same flag for a mid-turn snapshot (its context would lag the
  visible transcript); a session that never opened a kiro-cli context sets neither
  key (it had nothing to carry). When both conditions hold and Layer B is carried,
  `layer_b_skipped` is absent and the tab is not marked.
- **The filename is an egress surface, not decoration.** A name is displayed by
  whatever holds the file — a share, a bucket listing, a chat attachment — so the
  slug is built from the bundle's **already-redacted** title and never from
  `slot.title`.
- **An incognito or temporary session cannot be exported.** Those transcripts
  exist under a promise that nothing is kept, so writing one into a file is
  refused rather than best-effort served.
- **No conversation changes, and nothing installs.** An export creates, moves and
  deletes nothing, so a repeat costs the source nothing and the action needs no
  confirm step. It is not a pure read of the disk, though: like `send-session` it
  FLUSHES a dirty slot first, because slicing a stale transcript would ship a
  superseded turn — so an export can persist pending session state and fails
  rather than exporting when that write fails. Reading such a file back is
  `ImportSessionItem` beside this row, which posts the file's bytes unchanged to
  `/api/chat/slots/import` — see §14.5a for what that route accepts.

### 14.8 The `source` provenance record — recorded, never applied

An export carries an optional `source` object so a reader can answer "what was
this session running under?". Present on the file hop; the tunnel's bundle does
**not** carry it, because a send is an existing working flow and there is no
reason for this to change what it puts on the wire.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `model` | the model the source session was pinned to |
| `reasoning_effort` | the source's effort setting |
| `approval_policy` | `""` interactive, `"auto"` auto-approve every tool |
| `workspace`, `project` | named as text only; both are local scopes §14.3 drops. Credential- and exfiltration-redacted like the title, being the only free text in the record |
| `exported_at` | ISO instant the file was written |
| `producer` | the exporting gateway's version, for diagnosis only |

`origin` and `agent` are NOT repeated here — both already sit at the top level
of the bundle, where the importer reads them.

**The reader is a person, not a caller.** An export is a user-facing artifact
whose whole point is being inspectable (§14.7), and somebody deciding whether to
install a session needs to know what model produced it, at what effort, and above
all whether the transcript was produced under auto-approval. Every field earns
its place against THAT reader. A field only a future caller would want does not
go in, which is why `mode` and `autocompact_pct` are absent: both are re-derived
per turn, so they are pointless to apply and there is nothing for a human to do
with them either.

**Every field is display and diagnosis only. None of it is applied.**
`approval_policy` is why that has to be stated rather than left to taste:
`"auto"` means auto-approve every tool, so a bundle that carried it as an
*applied* setting would let a session arrive on another machine pre-authorised to
run tools without prompting — a privilege escalation across a trust boundary, and
the same class of defect `subagent._validate_agent` refuses when it declines to
default an unknown agent name. An imported session always lands interactive.

**No field is ever required.** A reader asks whether a key is present and
well-formed, never whether a version implies it must be there. That is the real
compatibility mechanism, because a version number only coordinates a linear
history: two forks can each add their own fields and each stamp the same number,
and a reader that trusted the number would then look for fields its own branch
associates with it. So `producer` records which code wrote a file for diagnosis
and is **never read as a gate**.

`approval_policy` has one wrinkle the others do not. It has no durable copy
anywhere — the live session object is its only home — so a conversation whose
session is gone (evicted, or not re-opened since a gateway restart) has no policy
to report. Absence therefore means "not known" while `""` means "interactive",
and the two are kept distinguishable on purpose: collapsing them would make the
field's only interesting reading, that a transcript was produced under
auto-approval, indistinguishable from a gateway with nothing to say.

## 15. Federated session search (search every connected instance at once)

`GET /api/instances/search-sessions` answers one query with sessions from the
local gateway **and** every instance whose tunnel is currently `CONNECTED`. The
dashboard's two search surfaces switch to it automatically whenever at least one
warm connection exists (the ⌘K palette's Sessions tab and the sidebar's Older
Sessions search); with no warm instance they keep calling the plain local
`/api/sessions/search`, so a peerless install never pays the detour.

### 15.1 It is the hub-initiated pull §14.6 anticipated

The search reuses the transfer's transport shape exactly: the hub GETs a peer's
own `/api/sessions/search` **over the already-open forward** — no SSH spawn, no
new port, no reverse reachability. `SshTunnelManager.search_sessions_remote`
follows `send_session_bundle`'s credential rules to the letter: **the token
never leaves the manager** (§6's invariant holds — `connect` and `refresh-token`
remain the only routes whose response carries one), it travels as the
port-scoped cookie so it cannot land in the peer's access log, and a `401/403`
gets exactly one transparent re-mint retry, because a retained credential can go
stale while the tunnel stays `CONNECTED`.

"Follows the same rules" is now **enforced rather than asserted**: all three
peer-request methods — `send_session_bundle`, `search_sessions_remote` and
`proxy_request` — resolve their target and credential through one shared private
pair, `_peer_target` (connected-only, loopback target, port-scoped cookie name)
and `_peer_cookie_header` (credential re-read per attempt, sent as a cookie,
never logged). A fourth caller inherits the invariant instead of copying it.
What is deliberately *not* shared is each method's error contract: the
`proxy_`/`transfer_`/`search_` code families belong to three separate route
contracts, so the helper reports a neutral reason and each caller names its own
code as a literal — a drift test asserts the three stay distinct.

Each peer request runs under `DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROXY_TIMEOUT_SECS` (6s) — sized
between the token probe (2s, a bare ping, which would produce false
"unreachable" verdicts on a loaded peer doing real scan work) and the transfer
budget (30s, which would let one dead tunnel stall a keystroke-driven search).
Peers are fanned out concurrently, so the slowest peer bounds the whole reply.

### 15.2 Merging without a cross-instance score

The aggregator **rank-interleaves**: position *k* of the reply cycles through
each source's *k*-th best hit, local source first. Raw scores are never compared
across gateways — each instance may run a different ranking version (a newer hub
searching an older peer, or vice versa), so a numeric merge would silently
prefer whichever version inflates its scores. Interleaving needs no score wire
format, keeps every source represented in the top rows, and preserves each
source's own internal order.

An unreachable or refusing peer never fails the request: it is reported in the
reply's `unreachable` array as `{id, name, code}` so a caller can tell what was
NOT searched instead of having the result set silently narrowed. The shipped
dashboard surfaces log the report (a visible "N instances unreachable" affordance
is a follow-up); only CONNECTED peers are fanned out, so a miss here is a rare
mid-search transient rather than the steady state for a down instance.
Machine-readable codes distinguish a stale credential (`search_unauthorized`)
from a dead tunnel (`search_unreachable`), a peer error (`search_peer_refused`),
and a garbled reply (`search_malformed_reply`); the same codes are recorded in
the SEL audit event for the request, so an operator can audit which peer failed
and why without reproducing the search.

### 15.3 Peer replies are untrusted input

A peer's rows are re-shaped through a strict allowlist before they reach the
browser: only known fields are copied, strings are type-checked, and `title` /
`snippet` are re-run through the local credential + exfiltration redaction — the
peer claims to have redacted, but this hub does not take its word for it. Rows
from a peer additionally carry `instance_id` + `instance_name`; local rows carry
neither, so the reply shape for a hub with no peers degrades to exactly the
local search's own.

The endpoint runs behind the same `_guard()` as every §6 route (owner-only,
never Slack, `instances.enabled`, SEL-audited as `instances_search_sessions`)
and mirrors the local search's input contract (`q` sanitized, capped at 256
chars, min `SEARCH_MIN_CHARS`; `limit` default 50, max 200). The local rows are
also redacted here: the aggregator calls `conversation_log.search_sessions`
directly rather than going through the `/api/sessions/search` handler where the
local redaction normally lives.

### 15.4 What the UI does with a remote row

A remote row's transcript lives on the other gateway, so the local dashboard can
neither resume nor delete it:

- **Activation switches panes.** Both surfaces route through
  `useSelectInstance` (the single owner of switch-to-a-pane semantics, §3), so
  clicking a remote row activates that instance's embedded pane —
  reconnecting it first if needed. Deep-linking to the specific session inside
  the embedded SPA is a follow-up: the iframe protocol has no open-session
  message yet.
- **The local delete action is hidden** on remote rows. `deleteHistorySession`
  targets the LOCAL session file; with colliding keys across gateways it would
  delete a same-keyed, unrelated local conversation.
- **⌘Enter (open in local split grid) is inert** for remote rows in the
  palette — bound to an explicit no-op, because an absent handler makes the
  palette's Enter dispatch fall back to plain activation and the chord would
  silently switch panes.
- Remote rows are badged with the instance's **raw name** (never translated —
  it is the user's own label, which also keeps the change i18n-neutral), and
  result ids are namespaced by instance so two gateways' same-keyed sessions
  cannot collide in the palette's keyed list. Snippet-highlight offsets are
  shifted by the prefix length so remote rows highlight the same match a local
  row would.
- Any federated-endpoint failure in the UI — including the `403` when the
  instances feature is off — falls back to the plain local search, which is
  always the floor.
