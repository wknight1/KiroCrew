# Crew Log Projections

## 1. Purpose

A session's crew log is an append-only file (`crew-log-core.md`). Every view of it
is a FOLD: `status`, `usage`, `timeline`, `tools`, `approvals` and `class` -- the
session side panel of the RFC's section 5 table, plus the one fold a READER of
another unit's log consults rather than a panel. This module is those five advertised folds, the internal `class` fold, the
slot-keyed `ledger` and `radar` folds, the two read routes that serve them, and the frame that
pushes a fold when the file grows.

The split it implements is RFC NFR-2: the backend folds and cuts pages, the
frontend renders and pages and never folds. A client that folded the log would
need the whole file to show one number.

The five panel folds each read ONE session unit and are the set the growth push
sends, so `PROJECTION_NAMES` holds those five. A fold in `SLOT_PROJECTION_NAMES` is
keyed by a SLOT rather than by one unit: a slot owns one ACP session id at a time,
so the state it accrues over its life is spread across a unit per id it ran under,
and answering for it means joining them. `SLOT_PROJECTION_NAMES` holds `ledger`
and `radar`, and those names are kept OUT of
`PROJECTION_NAMES` for that reason -- the growth push and the side panel address a
session, and pushing a slot-wide value under one session's id would report a partial
answer as the whole one. `FOLD_NAMES` is the union of the two, and the import-time
registry check compares a requested name against it.

Scope: the SESSION kind. The crew-kind projections (`roster`, `activity`,
`board`, `budget`, ...) are out of scope here because the crew kind has no writer
yet, and a fold with no producer cannot be tested against anything real.

## 2. The fold contract

A projection is a value plus the `seq` it was folded through (FR-5). Two
projections of one unit are therefore comparable, and a client reconnecting
truncates against that number rather than guessing.

A fold is three pure pieces:

| piece | what it is |
|---|---|
| start | the state before any entry |
| step | one entry applied to the state, in place |
| render | the state as the value a reader is served |

`fold(name, entries)` is those pieces run over every entry. The INCREMENTAL form
is the primitive and the whole-file form is one line on top of it, so a resumed
answer and a from-scratch answer come out of one implementation. Two
implementations would be free to disagree about the same bytes, with nothing in
the file to say which is right.

`Checkpoint` is `(name, last_seq, state)` and is JSON-serializable, so a caller
may store it and continue later. The state is deliberately NOT the rendered
value: a fold keeps bookkeeping a reader has no use for -- the open tool calls it
is matching by `call_id`, the attempt an open turn is on -- and keeping the two
apart is what lets the value stay the surface the dashboard reads. Writing that
state to disk is section 7.

`advance(checkpoint, entries)` does not touch its input. It copies the state
first, because these are frozen records and a returned one sharing a mutable dict
with its input would leave that input claiming a seq its state has moved past.

**A replayed entry is refused, not skipped.** Every entry must have a seq
strictly above the last one consumed. The two plausible causes want opposite
handling and `advance` cannot tell them apart: a caller re-reading a page it
already folded would have its totals counted twice, and a caller holding a
checkpoint for a unit that was removed and recreated would have the whole new log
swallowed as already-folded. So it refuses with `bad_data` and naming the
collision, and `fold_session` handles the recreated-unit case itself by
discarding a bundle whose seq is ahead of the file. It also carries the log
file's creation identity (`SessionProjections.origin`, the header's `createdAt`)
and reuses a bundle only when that identity still matches: a log removed and
recreated that has already grown PAST the cached seq passes the seq guard, so
without the identity check its stale state would be folded onto a different
file's bytes. An unknown identity never matches, so an older bundle without the
field falls back to a full rebuild.

**Absent is never read as zero.** `turn/completed` carries `credits` and `tokens`
only on a provider-reported close, so a synthesized closer omits them. A total
that counted those turns as costing nothing would state a measurement nobody
made, so every total in `usage` rides beside the count of turns that contributed
to it (`turns.credits_reported`, `turns.tokens_reported`), and a caller comparing
the two learns what the total covers.

**Nothing is synthesized.** An interrupted turn and an unmatched tool call are
reported OPEN. Closing them is `CrewLog.open(repair=True)`, which appends real
deterministic closers under write ownership; a reader inventing the same fact in
memory would make two readers of one file disagree about one turn.

**An unpairable id is counted, never paired.** `tool/*.call_id` and
`approval/*.approval_id` may be empty, and an empty id identifies nothing --
keying a map by it would make every such call the same call, so one completion
would close a different call's frame. An id longer than `ID_LIMIT` takes the same
path for the same reason: it is retained, so its size is part of the bound, and it
cannot be shortened to fit because two distinct ids sharing a head would collapse
into one identity. Both sides of a pair coerce the id identically, so the call and
its completion always agree on what an identity is. Those are counted
(`tools.unidentified_calls`, `approvals.unidentified_requests`) and left unpaired.

**Every value is bounded, in count and in size.** A projection is pushed over a
socket on each growth, so its size cannot depend on how long the session ran:
`timeline` keeps the newest `TIMELINE_LIMIT` moments and reports how many it
dropped, `tools` details `TOOL_NAME_LIMIT` names while keeping the totals exact
and counting the rest in `names_omitted`, and the open-call and pending-approval
lists are capped with their own omitted counts. The bound is on the RETAINED
checkpoint state, not only the rendered value: a session that leaks never-matched
`call_id`s or `approval_id`s stops retaining them past `OPEN_RETAIN_LIMIT`
(counted in `open_dropped`/`pending_dropped`), a single tool called through many
servers caps its retained server names at `SERVERS_PER_TOOL_LIMIT` and counts the
DISTINCT omitted ones in `servers_omitted`, and `usage` details at most
`MODEL_LIMIT` models while keeping the whole-session totals exact and counting
the rest in `models_omitted` -- so the deep-copied, cached checkpoint cannot
grow without bound over a long-lived session.

A cap on HOW MANY values are retained bounds nothing on its own, because every
one of those values is a string off the wire. Every retained string is cut to
`TEXT_LIMIT` at the point the fold coerces it -- an approval's tool and reason, a
decision, a server, a tool or model name, and the `status` echoes of agent, owner,
slot, cwd, model, provider, stop reason and error -- so a handful of near-64-KiB
strings cannot outweigh the entry budget they are counted against. A field whose
ABSENCE is meaningful keeps it: a close reason, a stop reason and an error read as
`null` when unset rather than as a reason of no characters.

Cutting is safe only for a label that never distinguishes one thing from another.
A string used as a KEY is refused instead of cut: a label sitting exactly at
`TEXT_LIMIT` cannot be told apart from one that was cut, so keying on it would put
two unrelated tools (or models) in one row reporting each other's totals, which is
a wrong answer rather than a big value. `tools.by_name` and `usage.by_model`
therefore give no detail row to a label at that length, and it goes where a label
past the COUNT budget goes: the whole-session totals stay exact, and the label is
reported as omitted detail. An IDENTITY is refused for the same reason at
`ID_LIMIT`, and both sides of a pair coerce it identically so a call and its
completion never disagree about what an identity is.

A count of omitted detail is a count of THINGS, not of the events that mentioned
them: a tool name reaches that path from its call and again from its completion,
and a model reaches it once per turn it ran. Both counts are therefore
deduplicated against a list, that list is itself capped like everything else
retained here, and with the cap reached a label cannot be recognised as one
already counted. `names_omitted`, `models_omitted` and each tool row's
`servers_omitted` stop at the budget rather than climbing past the number of
labels that exist, and `names_omitted_saturated`, `models_omitted_saturated` and
`servers_omitted_saturated` say the figure has become a floor rather than a total.

**A cold fold holds a chunk, not the file.** Five folds consume the same entries,
so a single generator would be exhausted by the first of them and the span has to
be materialized. Materializing the WHOLE span is what a cold fold does most often
-- with no reusable bundle the range starts at seq 1, which is the ordinary first
read for any session -- so the pass is taken `FOLD_CHUNK_ENTRIES` at a time: one
pass over the file, with what is held bounded. Folding a span in pieces is the
same value as folding it whole, because `advance` is seq-anchored and each chunk
is strictly after the last, and each checkpoint takes only the part of a chunk it
has not already consumed -- which is what lets one chunk serve every fold sitting
at different seqs.

## 3. The projections

### The panel folds, and `class` beside them

Each reads ONE session unit, and these FIVE are what the growth push sends. ``class``
is registered alongside them but is not advertised and is not pushed: no panel draws it
and its one caller asks the registry for it by name.

| projection | what it answers |
|---|---|
| `status` | Is this session open, and what is it doing: lifecycle, the open turn and its attempt, agent/owner/slot/cwd, current model and provider, turns completed and refused, the last stop reason, dropped writes. |
| `usage` | What it spent: credits and the four token dimensions, per model; the per-turn context bill by source kind from `context/composed`; compaction count and the context they freed; step count and time. |
| `timeline` | The newest turn, lifecycle and cost MOMENTS, oldest first. Message, step and tool entries are deliberately absent: they are the bulk of a log, the page route and `tools` already serve them, and including them would make the timeline a second copy of the file. |
| `tools` | Calls matched to completions by `call_id`: totals, per name, open calls, unmatched completions. An error is `status` in `refused`/`error`/`failed` OR `is_error` true -- two independent signals, and an absent `is_error` is not a claim that the call worked. |
| `approvals` | Requests matched to decisions by `approval_id`: pending, decided, the decision tally, the last decision. No emitter writes these types yet; the fold is against the declared shape. |
| `class` (INTERNAL -- not advertised, not pushed) | What KIND of session this log belongs to, over the log's WHOLE LIFE: the memory mode, the owning app, and whether the conversation was ever published to a channel. Each of those three is held at the most RESTRICTIVE value the log ever recorded, from the `class` object on the log's first `session/opened` plus every later `session/class` move, so a session published to a channel for one turn keeps reading as channel-published after the link is dropped -- that turn's content is still in this log. It also carries `workspace`, which folds differently because it is an IDENTITY rather than a restriction: there is no more-restrictive workspace to keep, so the FIRST one stated is held and a later different one sets `workspace_moved`, which is itself the restrictive fact -- a log whose content spans two workspaces is owned by neither. `recorded` says a class was stated at all and `complete` says the history has a beginning, and a reader deciding an authorization question refuses on either being false. The only fold whose consumer is a READER of another unit rather than a panel, which is why it is held restrictive rather than current: a fold that reported the present value would answer a question nobody asks of a log. |

### The slot-keyed folds

| projection | what it answers |
|---|---|
| `ledger` | The session work ledger's state record: goal, phase, resumable next step, rejected approaches, artifact pointers, and a bounded event tail. It interprets only `ledger/recorded` and renders the ten fields every reader of that record expects (`session-work-ledger.md`). |
| `radar` | An Issue Radar crew's ledger: its work items (newest progress first), a bounded tail of progress lines, its own passes for the repository's shared skip index, and the per-item history of phase entries. It interprets only `radar/recorded` and renders the shapes the crew page, the fabric and the `issue_radar_crew_read` tool already expect (`apps/builtins/issue_radar/backend/crew_ledger_spec.md`). |

A slot-keyed fold is the module's stated exception to "one fold, one unit", and it
is stated rather than assumed, because a reader has to know which kind of fold it
holds. A slot owns one ACP session id at a time rather than for its whole life, so
the record it answers for is spread over a unit per id the slot ran under.
`fold_slot_checkpoint` folds those units oldest first, RE-BASING the seq guard at
each one: a seq is comparable only within one file, so the second unit's entries all
sit at or below the first unit's seq, and `advance` would refuse the whole file as a
re-fold. The state carries forward across the boundary while the seq restarts.
`fold_slot` renders the result for the ledger's route; the radar fold's owner (the
crew store) renders the checkpoint itself, since it also advances it over the entry
it is appending. The units either joins are still exactly one slot's own,
so nothing reads across slots -- the radar fold's one cross-crew read, the
repository's skip index, is a union the app makes OVER per-crew folds, not a fold
that reads another slot's units.

`session_units_for_slot` supplies that list. It names the units whose HEADER can be
PROVED to belong to the store holding it, ordered by the header's `createdAt` and
then by unit id so a tie is stable -- which is the order the units were opened in,
and therefore the order their entries happened in, so a later update wins over an
earlier one. A caller that cannot tolerate a clock's ordering re-orders the list
itself: the ledger's `crew_log_units` applies its own append-order log and drops the
units a permanent delete excluded before folding, because a backward clock step
would otherwise apply a retired session's goal over a later one's
(`session-work-ledger.md`); the radar fold's owner keeps the order the crew RECORDED
into its units and pins the crew's LIVE unit last, for the same reason. `read_slot_projection`
is the slot-keyed read the `ledger` route uses, and `slot_of_session` resolves a
session-addressed request to the slot recorded in that session's header: the header
rather than a session mapping, because it is written once inside the fenced tree and
cannot be made to name another conversation's slot. The radar fold takes no generic
read route: this module folds it for its owner and the owner serves it, so no reader
can be handed the listing as stored without the owner's ordering.

A reader that folds on every loop wake would re-walk the whole log each time, since
the fold interprets only its own entry type but still reads every line to find it.
So each owner keeps the checkpoint (per slot for the ledger, per crew for the radar
fold) and advances it over what arrived since, through this module's own `advance`.
A changed unit list, a unit whose seq went backwards, growth in any unit but the
newest, or a cold cache each force a full rebuild, because each would otherwise be a
wrong answer rather than a slow one.

The radar fold's own rules, applied to the bytes as the writer applies them to a
request: an entry naming a crew other than the fold's first is left out (every unit
of one slot belongs to one crew); an entry identical to the item's LAST applied
update is applied once (a retry re-stamped later), while an identical update after
intervening ones is a new update and applies; a name in the entry's `clear` list
empties that field before the same entry's set fields apply; consecutive crew-level
sweeps coalesce; a crew-level kind with a number, or a number-less entry with an
item kind, is dropped; the FIRST pass recorded on a number stands; each CI member and
the label count are re-bounded to the record tool's own limits; and a `carried`
entry re-states a pre-projection record with its own stamps (a rejected approach it
already lists is not appended again), while a carried pass on an issue the crew never
worked records the row and no work item.

## 4. Reads

| route | answers |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/sessions/{id}/crew-log?from=&to=` | The entries in a seq range, oldest first, with every `ref` on the page resolved (FR-4). |
| `GET /api/sessions/{id}/crew-log/projection/{name}` | One fold's `value` and the `seq` it folded through. A slot-keyed name this route serves (`ledger`) is resolved to the slot recorded in that session's own header first, and the fold then joins every unit the slot ran under; a session whose slot cannot be proved gets the empty fold, never another slot's. A slot-keyed fold served by its OWNER (`radar`) is refused here (400 `unknown_projection`, the answer an unregistered name gets): folding the one unit this route addresses would serve a part of the record as the whole. |
| `GET /api/sessions/{id}/crew-log/projections` | Every fold, keyed by name, from ONE resolution and ONE pass over the unit, so a caller showing them together cannot be handed a mix from two units. Each fold keeps its own `seq`, which differs by design: an entry advances the folds it belongs to and leaves the rest. |

**The BATCH read answers two things the folds cannot.** A fold says what it holds;
it cannot say why it holds nothing, nor whether it was read mid-write. Both fields
are on `/crew-log/projections` alone, because both exist for a surface showing folds
TOGETHER and no caller of the per-name route reads either -- and the settle one
of them needs is a wait charged to every request that carries it. The per-name and
page reads resolve their id the same way; they simply do not report these:

`resolved` -- whether a unit was NAMED for the id sent. An empty fold has two
causes that a reader must not be shown interchangeably: a session with no unit yet --
one that has not run a turn -- and one whose ACP session was torn down (an idle reset,
a model or agent switch, a compaction that recycles it) and whose entries are still on
disk under the retired id. Both arrive as `seq: 0`, so without this flag a surface
reporting "nothing recorded" states a cause as fact about the reader's own data. The
panel says the record is not addressable instead, and names both possibilities rather
than asserting the retired one.

This deliberately does NOT fall back to the persisted session map to find that
retired id. `SessionMap.get` repairs or removes an entry it judges stale, so
consulting it would make a panel READ mutate session state, which is the reason
`crew_log/resolve.py` documents for never touching it. And a retired unit belongs
to a session this slot no longer is: presenting its totals here would imply a
whole-life figure, which needs the lineage pointer (`session/opened.data.previous`)
and a fold that follows it -- neither exists yet (§8).

`writes_drained` -- whether the emitter owed nothing when the fold was taken. An
append is handed to a queue and the entry point returns, so a turn can END with its
last entries unwritten, and the refresh that turn's end triggers would fold a file
the turn has not finished writing. The batch read waits for `emit.flush` up to
`_SETTLE_SECONDS` first and reports which happened; false means the value may be
behind, which the footer says rather than presenting it as current. The wait is
global rather than per session because a batch the writer has already CLAIMED is
absent from the per-session queue and invisible there, so a session-scoped
predicate would report quiet in exactly the case that matters.

**`{id}` is a unit id OR a session key, and both reads resolve it the same way.**
A session's crew log is keyed by the ACP session id the turn path holds, and a
dashboard caller has no way to learn one: it is on no payload the client reads, and
putting it on the wire to let a client rewrite it into a path would widen what a
client is trusted with. So a key that the session registry recognises is resolved
to the unit it is serving through `crew_log.resolve.unit_for_session_key`, and an
id the registry does not recognise -- which is what an ACP id is, since it is not a
session key -- is used VERBATIM. That ordering is what keeps a unit-id-addressed
read working unchanged, and there are now two such callers on main: the
`kirocrew-crew-log` MCP server reads a unit by id through the unit-keyed door
described below, and the `session_projection` frame carries the unit it folded as
`session_id`, so anything taking an id out of a frame addresses by unit id too.
Both responses echo the id the CALLER sent, never the resolved one: a client polling
by key matches the answer to its request, and the internal identity stays off the wire.

**A slot key is resolved to the session its turns RUN on, not to itself.** A
channel-born slot runs its turns on the channel's own session and carries that key
in `linked_session_key` (`slack:<ts>`), so the ACP provider is registered under THAT
key. The resolver is an exact registry lookup whose one retry is the `dashboard:`
form, so a read that passed the bare slot key would miss the provider and fold an
empty record for every channel-linked session -- and never recover, because that
mapping is stable rather than racy. The read therefore asks
`chat_utils.effective_session_key`, the function that owns the mapping, before it
asks the resolver. That stays inside the invariant this path depends on: it is a pure
attribute read, with no disk and no session-state mutation. An id naming no live slot
passes through untouched, which is what an ACP unit id is.

Nothing enforces that a provider's session id can never equal a live session key --
the two are minted by different code -- so the ORDER is what decides a collision,
and it decides it in favour of the registry: an id the registry recognises is
resolved. That is the branch every chat read depends on, and a test pins it, so the
precedence is a decision rather than a side effect of the lookup's fallback.

The resolution is POINT-IN-TIME, and inherits exactly the guarantee
`crew_log/resolve.py` states: it answers which unit a key's work is landing in
*now*. A reset, an agent/model/effort switch, a compaction that recycles the ACP
session and a provider swap all start a new unit, so a key-addressed read after one
of those folds the CURRENT record and not the retired one -- totals drop, and
nothing in the answer says why. A key whose session was torn down and not
re-created resolves to nothing and reads back the empty fold at seq 0, which is the
same answer a session with no entries gets; the difference is not observable from
here. A reader that must span a slot's retired units needs the lineage pointer
(`session/opened.data.previous`) and a fold that follows it, which this module does
not do. The dashboard panel states the limit in its own footer rather than implying
a whole-life total.

Those two are the BROWSER's door: cookie auth, keyed on a session id the dashboard
already holds. A second, unit-keyed door serves the `kirocrew-crew-log` MCP server
over the same `read_page` and projection reads, on the strict internal transport
only: `GET /api/crew-log/sessions` lists units, `GET /api/crew-log/resolve` answers
which unit a caller's key lands in, and `GET /api/crew-log/units/{unit}/page` and
`/projection/{name}` are the unit-keyed forms of the two above.

That second door asks for a valid strict session identity and then a SCOPE: a
session reads its own unit, the unit of any session it dispatched -- transitively,
from the creator edge recorded on the dispatched session's own `session/opened`
entry -- and, when it is the owner at a dashboard tab whose own caller class allows
it, any unit. The listing carries
the same scope as a filter, because an unscoped listing would name every session on
the host and a per-unit gate cannot refuse that after the fact. A conductor reading
the crew logs of the sub-sessions it dispatched is the ordinary shape of the work,
and the lineage record already says which session created which, so the entitlement
comes from a recorded fact. Issues #11963 and #12025 were closed as not planned for
that reason.

The lineage is not the whole entitlement, because it OUTLIVES a workspace switch: the
creator edge is written on the dispatched session and nothing rewrites it, so a
conductor that dispatched a child and then moved workspace still names that child in
its tree. Both doors therefore compare the caller's workspace against the one the
target's class recorded. The per-unit door refuses the read; the listing drops the row,
so a boundary the read door enforces for content cannot be walked around by reading
the enumeration instead. A row admitted as the caller's OWN, and an owner's unscoped
view, are not asked -- the same two cases the per-unit door answers before any target
test.

The maintainer decision this implements is the DISPATCH fence, not an unrestricted
read. The wider premise -- that
sessions on one gateway belong to one operator, so any may read any other -- was
put forward and does not hold, because it does
not reach a channel-linked session, whose conversation is a Slack or Telegram thread
several allow-listed people read and prompt-injectable content enters. Nor does
parity with `session_read_message` support it: that tool's own gate
(`session_control.authorize_target`) refuses precisely those caller classes, so it is
narrower than an unrestricted read rather than an example of one. So the CALLER
classes it refuses -- unattended, app-scoped,
incognito, channel-linked or mirrored -- are mirrored here from that module's own
constants, and each of those callers keeps its own unit while being refused another
session's. The owner's dashboard arm is held to the same caller classes, because a
dashboard session mirrored to a channel republishes every turn and would otherwise be
the one caller entitled to read every log and publish it. The door also refuses a
caller off the internal transport, a request
naming another component, and a session the gateway cannot name -- that last one is
what keeps the audit record of WHICH session read a log worth having.

The fence keys on SLOTS. A slot outlives its ACP session, so a gateway restart gives
the same tab a new session id and a new unit; keying on `parent.sid` would hand a
re-attached conductor a chain naming the unit it used to write to and lock it out of
children it had dispatched minutes earlier. The transitive walk is section 6's own
fold rather than a second slot map, so the fence and the tree cannot disagree.

The target side is mirrored in TWO tests, because the question is asked about
sessions that no longer exist. The first reads the class recorded on the target's own
`session/opened` entry -- the memory mode, the owning app, whether its conversation
is published to a channel -- which is what makes a CLOSED child decidable; a log
carrying no such record is REFUSED rather than assumed unrestricted, so every unit
opened before the field existed is outside a cross-session read. The second reads the
target's live slot, which is the only thing that can see a class the session acquired
after it opened. Either refuses. A CLOSED session is otherwise admitted: reading a
finished child's recorded work is what this door is for, and `authorize_target`
answers 404 for it.

Both the CALLER's class and the TARGET's are asked again after the entries are read. A
read of another session's log is decided on the loop and then performed off it, and
that offload is a suspension point: the caller can acquire a channel link or a mirror
while the entries are being gathered, and so can the target. The caller half stops one
act exactly, and claims no more than it: the route does not hand another session's
content to a caller that is publishing AT THE HANDOFF. That is the scenario of a prompt
to paste a dispatched child's log, a mirror bound while the read is suspended, and a
reply that publishes the private log. The target's RECORDED class
is folded again, and for its own reason
rather than as belt and braces: that fold reads the log's WHOLE life, so a
``session/class`` move appended while the payload was being gathered makes it answer
more restrictively than it did at the grant, and the words of a channel turn the
target took during the read would otherwise come back. What makes the re-fold exact is
where the class is RECORDED: every surface that commits a change to it records the
change at the moment it commits, not at the next sample, so a class that governs any
content in the log is already stated in the log ahead of that content. A record is
therefore never later than what it governs -- which is the property the re-fold needs,
and one no amount of sampling supplies. Because each member is held at the most
restrictive value ever recorded, a
re-fold can only withdraw a grant, never widen one. It is incremental, so a log that
did not move costs nothing.

One residual is KNOWN and stated rather than papered over: a caller entitled at the
handoff that acquires a channel link AFTERWARDS holds the payload in context and can
publish it on a later turn. Nothing at turn emission inspects a turn for another
session's log content -- the gateway has no provenance tracking on delivered content --
so no refusal in this route can claw that back. The two cases differ in kind rather than
in timing: the first is the gateway delivering content INTO a published session, which
this route performs and therefore controls; the second is a session becoming published
while holding content it was entitled to receive. Closing the second needs provenance on
delivered content and is not in this module's scope. A LISTING is re-checked by
recomputing its scope and comparing, since its rows were gathered under the scope the
caller held at the gate. The CREATOR EDGE is the one input not asked again: it
comes from an entry that cannot be rewritten, and an append-only store can only gain
descendants, never take back a unit the caller was already placed above. What the
grant leaves on the request is therefore a MARK naming which arm granted, never data:
the re-check can re-derive every value, but not which target test it owes, since the
owner arm owes none. A read of the caller's own unit is exempt on the
same ground the first arm is: the classes govern reading past one's own record. The
denial is audited under the operation name the grant was, so the audit log carries the
true sequence rather than a grant quietly withdrawn. The argument in full, including
why the fence's integrity guarantee is untouched, is in
`docs/reference/crew-log/reading-from-an-agent.md`.

A page reports the tail it OBSERVED, not the one its handle remembers. `last_seq`
on a store handle is that handle's own cached figure -- authoritative only for its
own appends -- and a reader never appends, so a writer growing the file after the
handle opened is invisible to it. The pass over the file is live and walks the
whole tail from `from`, discarding what is past `to` rather than never seeing it,
so the real end is observable at no extra cost and both `last_seq` and `next_from`
come from it. Taking them from the cached figure instead would let a page return
rows up to `to` and still report that nothing follows, and a client that believes
it stops paging with entries left unread.

**A seq is only comparable within one file.** The push skips a projection whose
checkpoint has not moved, and a seq alone does not establish that: `fold_session`
refuses a bundle whose origin does not match the file and rebuilds from the start,
so a log removed and recreated can come back at the same terminal seq carrying
different values. The push compares the bundle's ORIGIN first and treats every
projection of a rebuilt bundle as new; comparing seqs alone would suppress every
frame and leave each client holding the retired file's projection, with no later
growth able to dislodge it.

**The push is a per-process singleton, so a restart rebinds it.** A second install
returns the same publisher, and rebinding only the event loop would leave it
holding the retired dashboard state: `_watchers` would count the old hub's sockets
and every frame would go to a room nobody is in, which reads exactly like a session
that quietly stopped updating. The rebind repoints both the loop and the state, and
clears the scheduling flags, which belong to the loop going away -- a timer armed
there never fires and a flush marked in flight there never finishes, so a stale
flag would silence the publisher permanently. The dirty set is kept: those sessions
did grow, the entries are on disk, and the next pass folds them forward.

The RFC spells the range route `/sessions/<id>/ledger`. The feature is named crew
log, and the dashboard mounts its API under `/api`, so the served path is
`/api/sessions/{id}/crew-log`.

A range wider than the store's page cap is CLAMPED rather than refused, and
`next_from` carries the rest: asking for a whole log is a reasonable question and
the answer is pages. `from` defaults to 1 and `to` to one default page.

A resolved ref carries the citation's VERDICT and span -- `{status, entries,
first_seq, last_seq}` -- and never the cited bytes. Those lines are a page of
their own unit, which this same route serves, and inlining them would let one
page carry up to `MAX_REF_SPAN` lines per entry. Identical refs on one page are
resolved once, and a page resolves at most `MAX_PAGE_REFS` distinct refs, past
which the entry keeps its `ref` with no resolution and the page reports
`refs_unresolved`.

**A page and a fold take opposite postures on a type they do not know**, and the
difference is deliberate. A fold passes its vocabulary to `iter_from`, so a
required unknown type raises `unknown_entry_type` (served as 409) rather than
letting the fold answer with a total that line may have changed. A page passes no
vocabulary: it renders history for a person, where an unfamiliar line is a
missing detail rather than a wrong answer, and refusing the page would hide the
history in front of it. That is the posture `crew-log-core.md` section 6 states for
`page` and `resolve`, applied to a range read.

A session with no crew log is not an error: the page reads as empty with
`exists: false`, and each projection is the empty one at seq 0. A session that
ran with `KIROCREW_CREW_LOG` off has none, and the panel renders without
first asking whether the file exists.

Both routes are gated on the DASHBOARD OWNER. `resolve` makes no authorization
claim, because the storage layer has no caller identity to derive one from, and
says the first caller with a permission model owns the question; these routes are
that caller. A crew log holds the session's message bodies, redacted but whole,
so the audience is the person the conversation belongs to.

## 5. The push

A `session_projection` frame carries `{session_id, name, seq, value}` and is sent
to OWNER sockets, matching the read gate: an app token is an authorized socket and
is not the conversation's owner.

The trigger is the emitter's growth signal. `crew_log.emit`'s write-behind
already groups a turn's burst into one drained batch, and
`add_growth_listener` reports that batch -- so a consumer is woken once per pass
rather than once per entry. The listener is REGISTERED rather than imported: the
emitter is imported by the dashboard, so calling a dashboard publisher from it
would close an import cycle and put a reader's name in the writer's code.

The publisher runs the reading half on the event loop, never on the writer
thread: `notify` hands the id to the loop and returns. It then coalesces for
`COALESCE_SECONDS`, folds every advertised projection from ONE incremental read of the
entries that arrived, and sends a frame only for a projection whose `seq` moved --
re-sending an unchanged value would spend a socket write to say nothing.

A flush pass runs to completion before the next one starts. A growth arriving
during a slow fold does not launch an overlapping pass: two `_publish` for one
session would otherwise share the same prior bundle and race the cache write, so
an older `seq` could be broadcast last. When a pass finishes with more work
marked, it schedules the next pass itself.

Fold state is cached for at most `MAX_CACHED_SESSIONS` sessions; an evicted
session folds from the start on its next growth. When no dashboard user has a
socket open the pass folds nothing, because the state stays cached and the next
growth continues from where it is, so skipping costs no accuracy.

The storage package is imported LAZILY by the handler module, never at import
time. The crew log is optional behind `KIROCREW_CREW_LOG`, this module sits
on the dashboard's boot path, and a gateway launched with the flag unset must not
pay to load a store it will not read -- the same split the emitter keeps, pinned
by a test that imports the module in a clean interpreter.

Installing the push is gated on the same flag, and gated BEFORE the emitter is
imported. `start_dashboard` calls the installer unconditionally, so asking the
emitter whether it is enabled would import it on every disabled launch -- which is
the cost the flag exists to avoid, not a check of it. The variable's name is
therefore spelled in this module and a test pins that spelling against the
emitter's own constant, so the duplication cannot drift unnoticed. With the flag
off the installer builds no publisher and registers no listener.

**A close does not close a turn.** A session cut off mid-turn writes
`session/closed` with no `turn/completed`, and the `status` fold leaves the open
turn standing. Clearing it would assert the turn finished when nothing recorded it
doing so, and would erase the one fact a reader wants from that log: this session
died with work in flight. A reader sees `closed_at` and the open turn together and
can tell exactly what happened. Only `turn/completed` closes a turn.

## 6. The session tree -- the one fold across logs

Every fold above reads its own unit's file and nothing else (FR-4). Two readers
look across logs, and they read the SAME recorded edge for different questions:
the session tree here, and the dispatch fence in section 5. The `session_create`
edge is recorded on the CHILD (`crew-log-core.md` section 5), so "which session
opened which" is not in any one log.

The tree (`crew_log/session_tree.py`) folds EVERY log and keys the result by
SLOT, because it answers "what does the whole tree look like" for a display, and
the live row a child nests under is the slot's -- a slot outlives its ACP
session. The fence (`crew_log/read.py`, `dispatch_view`) keys on SLOT for the
same reason, and does not fold the collection a second time: it calls
`session_tree.SessionTree.records` and `session_tree.fold_tree` and adds only the
unit-to-slot map a read needs, because a request names a unit while the lineage
is recorded between slots. So the two readers share one fold and cannot disagree
about who dispatched whom -- an earlier sid-keyed walk here could not, since a
restart gives a tab a new session id and the recorded `parent.sid` then named a
unit the re-attached creator no longer writes to. `sid` stays on the entry as the
audit citation for which log held the creating call, which is what the module
docstring means by a reader of the logs themselves; neither reader keys on it.

The tree is a different kind of thing from a fold in the sections above on purpose.
It is a fold over the collection, the shape dsh's `flattenLineage` takes over its
per-session `parentSession` header field: the record lives on the child, the tree is
a pure function over all the records, and an orphan or a cycle degrades to root
rather than to an error.

**What is read.** For every unit directory under the session root
(`store.unit_dirs`), the HEADER and the FIRST ENTRY of the oldest surviving
segment (`store.oldest_segment`, `store.read_head`) -- one bounded read per log
however long the session ran. That is enough: the emitter writes `parent` from a
process-local mint witness that exists before the child's first turn or never, so
the entry that created the log carries the parent whenever any entry does, and a
re-attach in the same process can only repeat it. A unit is refused the way
`unit_header_slot` refuses one -- a linked entry, a non-session header, a header
whose id does not fold back to its directory name -- and a header with no entry
behind it yet (the create landed, the announce has not) yields nothing and is
read again next scan rather than cached.

**The fold** (`fold_tree`, pure; input order does not matter):

| Case | Node |
|---|---|
| no record of the slot carries `parent` | root, `parent: None` |
| some record carries `parent` and a log with that slot exists | the edge is followed: the child nests under the creator |
| the cited slot has no log of its own (orphan) | root; `parent` kept as the citation |
| the edges close a cycle, or a slot cites itself | every member is marked `cycle: True` and nests nowhere; a slot hanging off a member keeps its edge to it |
| two records of one slot disagree | the OLDEST log's word stands (`createdAt`, then id); a slot that carries a `parent` at all is one `session_create` minted (`chat-<N>-<ts>`: a monotonic counter plus the unix second, the counter reseeded past every restored key at boot), so such a key is never a dead session's recycled one, and the oldest word is the creation's own |
| a record with no slot in its header | dropped -- it has no place in a slot-keyed tree |

A record without `parent` never retracts one: create -> re-attach (with parent)
-> gateway restart -> re-attach (no parent, the witness is gone) folds to the
parent the first log recorded, and so does a slot whose later logs were opened
after a restart. The tree is keyed by slot and reads `parent.slot` only:
`parent.sid` on the entry is the creator's ACP session id at the moment of
creation, an audit citation for a reader of the logs themselves (`crew-log-core.md`
section 5), and a slot outlives its ACP session, so it is not what a live row
nests on. Nothing reads it today; a reader that shows a session's own log would.

**The cache, and its bound.** `SessionTree` keeps one head per unit directory,
validated per scan against the segment path and its `(st_dev, st_ino)`. No mtime:
the store never rewrites a written line, so the two lines a scan reads are
immutable for as long as the segment exists, and an mtime key would re-read a live
session's log on every append. An untouched unit costs one `stat`; a segment that
is gone (retention, removal) or replaced (a new inode under the same name) is
re-read; a unit that yields nothing is dropped from the cache. A read that fails
outright (an `OSError` after the `stat` succeeded: a moment's I/O fault, or a unit
retention removed between the two calls) is no verdict on the bytes, so nothing is
cached for it: the next scan reads the unit again, or finds it gone and evicts it.
A cached failure would hide that session's creator until the segment rolled or
the process restarted.

A scan ADMITS at most `TREE_UNIT_CAP` (4096) units, and the cap cuts EVERY loop
of the scan, not only what it retains: the live sessions' logs are probed first
(the sampler names them by ACP session id, `store.unit_dir_for`, one `stat`
each, through `islice(preferred, cap)` so absent ids cost no more than the cap
in probes); the store's listing (`store.unit_dirs`, in the directory's own
order, excluding what is already admitted) fills the rest of the cap and stops
one candidate past it; the cache holds one head per admitted unit; and every
string a head retains is bounded at admission (`MAX_ACP_SESSION_ID_LEN` for the
id, `MAX_SHORT_STRING` for the slot keys; an oversize value refuses the unit
rather than truncating to a key that matches nothing). What lies past the cap is
neither walked, read, cached nor counted -- counting it would mean walking the
population, which is the cost the bound refuses -- and THAT something lies past
it lands in `SessionTree.over_cap`, reported on every payload as
`totals.lineage_over_cap` beside `totals.lineage_cap` (the constant, so the
page can say "4,096+"). The Sessions table's footer shows that as an ordinary
stat, "Stored session logs", not in the page's warn colour, only while it is
true: it removes no row from the page, so it is information about the store, and
its label names logs on disk because the strip already counts sessions, task
sessions and session procs, and a fifth "session" figure would read as a fifth
live count. Its hint names the cap itself ("more than 4,096 exist", the value
interpolated from `totals.lineage_cap`), since the bubble opens away from the
stat it explains, and leads with what it means (old logs are piling up), says
what it can cost the page (below), names where its remedy is typed ("in a
terminal run:"),
and what to do (the `kirocrew config set` command for the retention setting,
named as the one switch that also expires the transcripts the Archive page
lists, since `store.sweep_expired` runs off the same value), stating no default,
since the default lives in `config/sections.py` and prose restating it would go
stale silently. Because the live logs go first, what the cap leaves unread is
closed sessions' logs, and a live row nests on one of those in exactly one
case: a slot that outlived a gateway restart, whose current log was opened
without a `parent` (the witness is gone) and whose creator is named only by its
older, closed log -- a unit that competes in directory order like any other and
can fall past the cap. Such a row folds as a root while the store is over the
cap, which is why the hint says a session restarted since it was opened may show
as top-level instead of under its opener, rather than that nothing on the page is
affected. The hint also says what the retention command removes and keeps, since
a reader who fears losing transcripts will not run it: only closed sessions' logs
and the old saved transcripts (the rotated archives) older than the days set go; running sessions
and anything newer stay (`store.sweep_expired` removes only a unit whose close is
terminal; `history._cleanup_old_archives` deletes only rotated archive files). The
Storage screen's age sweep is not the remedy for this pile: it moves transcripts
and kiro-cli replay logs to the Trash and never touches a crew-log unit, so a hint
that sent the reader there would promise a shrink that does not happen. Every
other live row folds, over the cap or not -- with one bound: the preferred set
is capped too, so a gateway running more live logged sessions than the cap
loses lineage on the rows past it. A unit that fell past the cap because the
population changed is evicted like a removed one. What a poll costs at the cap,
measured on a local disk with 4,096 units: the cold first scan (one root
listing, one listing and one head read per unit) took 376 ms; a warm scan (the
root listing, one listing and one `stat` per unit, every head from the cache)
took 90-120 ms, and the fold on top of it is within that. The sampler runs the
scan on the executor beside its other filesystem work, and the page polls every
5 s, so a store at the cap costs about 2% of one core while the Sessions tab is
open and nothing while it is not. The cap is far above any population retention leaves; a
store that reaches it usually has retention disabled, though a store with more
than that many unexpired logs reaches it too. `test_crew_log_session_tree.py` measures
the invariant rather than reading it off the code: a scan handed ten times the
cap in absent ids makes exactly the cap's worth of probes, a store three times
the cap is examined for cap + 1 candidates, and the cache never exceeds the cap.

The scan is blocking and runs where the sampler's other filesystem work runs, on
the subprocess executor, never on the event loop. A scan that raises is logged and
reported as an empty tree: the tree decorates the pages that show it, and a store
fault must not take them down.

**The wire.** Each session row of `GET /api/sessions/memory` carries `parent`:
`null` for a session nobody created, otherwise `{slot, key}` -- the cited creator
slot, and `key` the creator's LIVE session key when the creator is running and the
edge can be followed (`null` for a creator that is not running, a node on a cycle,
or a citation pointing at the row itself). The join from a log's slot to a live
row is by slot key alone: a dashboard row's key is `dashboard:{slot.key}` and its
log -- and any child citing it -- carries the bare `slot.key`. `totals` carries
`lineage_over_cap` and `lineage_cap` (above); the sampler hands the tree the live
rows' ACP session ids (`runtime_pids` carries each as `sid`, bounded by
`MAX_ACP_SESSION_ID_LEN` at retention) so those logs are read first. The Memory column's hint says each row is its own runtime's figure, a parent's figure does not include the rows nested under it, and a group's header row under Group by is the one row that does total (TanStack's sum aggregation on the grouped column, which is the base table's behaviour), so the reader is not left to guess which bold rows sum. A task row carries a muted "task" marker before its name: once created sessions nest too, indent alone no longer says which kind an indented row is, and the kind otherwise showed only on hover (a session's name underlines, a task's does not). A folded session's count is the visible text "M MB in N hidden rows", unit included and the memory bound to the rows in the words (beside the parent's own Memory cell a bare "N rows, M MB" left the reader unsure which figure was whose): it counts sessions and tasks, where the footer's "nested" counts sessions only, and a bare numeral beside that reads as either; the memory is the hidden rows' own figures summed, carried on the badge because a folded parent's figure is its own and without the roll-up beside it the fold reads as a family total (a row with no memory data contributes nothing, and a fold with none shows the count alone). The
System page's Sessions table nests a session under `parent.key` exactly as it
nests a task under its `parent`, to whatever depth the creating went, with a task
under whichever session spawned it wherever that session sits; a created session
whose creator is not running is a top-level row that still carries its citation.
A row nested under its creator needs no further citation: its place in the tree
is one, and the creator's expander names the relation ("Collapse sessions under
{name}"). A created row that could NOT be nested (creator not running, a cycle)
says who opened it as VISIBLE text under its name -- "Created by {creator} (not
running, so shown top-level)", the creator's display name when it has a live row, else the slot the
log cited; the parenthetical names the one reason a created row is top-level
that real creation order can produce (a cycle is the other, and cannot arise
from ``session_create``, which never lets a child create its own ancestor) --
never as a native `title`: a keyboard or touch reader sees no tooltip, and this
row has nothing else that says it. The table re-checks the edge it is handed --
a key naming no row in the payload, or a chain returning to its own start --
because a table must never fail to paint on a payload it did not produce.

## 7. Savepoints on disk

A fold is cheap per entry and unbounded in total, so folding from seq 1 makes the
projection route cost what the session's whole history costs. The push avoids that
with the in-memory bundle above, but that cache dies with the process and holds
`MAX_CACHED_SESSIONS` sessions, so a restart and an eviction each pay for the file
again. `crew_log/checkpoint.py` is RFC NFR-1's answer: each fold's state written
beside the log it came from and resumed on the next read. Measured on a
10,001-entry (1.48 MB) log, all five projections, best of five runs on one host:
184.4 ms to fold cold, 44.8 ms to resume with nothing new to fold, 105.5 ms to
resume with a short tail, 197.1 ms on the read that also earns a new savepoint,
and 24 KB of files. Read those as ratios on one host rather than as portable
constants.

An earlier revision of that sentence said 3.2 ms to resume. It was measured before
the prefix digest existed and is no longer true of any resume: the digest is
verified on the way in and rechecked after the pass, and those two hashes are
essentially the whole of the 44.8 ms. Section 6 gives the attribution.

One file per fold, inside the unit's own directory, which the RFC's section 3
already names:

```
<store dir>/projections/<fold>.json
{"v", "unit", "origin", "first_seq", "fold", "seq", "prefix_sha", "prefix_records", "state"}
```

One file per fold rather than one for all five, so a payload this build cannot
read costs that fold its savepoint instead of costing all of them, and so a caller
asking for one projection writes one file. The name is a fold name that passed
`require_name`, so it can only ever be one of the five words this package
declares. The store reads its segments by name (`log.jsonl`, `log.<first_seq>.jsonl`)
and ignores every other neighbour, and removal deletes the unit's whole directory,
so the files need no registration on either side.

**Disposable, and that is the property to keep.** Every failure -- no file, a
truncated one, a payload from a build this one does not understand, a store the
file no longer describes -- is answered by folding from seq 1, which reaches the
same value at more cost. `load` and `save` therefore never raise: nothing a reader
is served depends on a savepoint existing or being current, and the tests state
each rejection as "the fold still lands on the cold answer".

**An append-only prefix never invalidates one.** The entries a savepoint consumed
cannot change, so folding what came after reaches what a cold fold reaches -- the
section 2 equality, now with a file behind it. Four things break it, and each is
checked before a file is used:

| check | what it catches |
|---|---|
| `origin` | a unit removed and recreated under the same id. Its seqs start again, so once the new file grows past the stored seq a seq check alone passes. It is the same value `SessionProjections.origin` compares, spelled once in `log_origin`, because two spellings of "same log" could disagree and the lenient one would fold a retired file's state onto a live file's bytes. |
| `first_seq` | the log lost its FRONT. Retention deletes whole segments off the oldest end, so a cold fold now folds a window while the savepoint still counts entries that are gone. The savepoint's answer is the one no reader can reproduce, so it is the one that is retired. |
| `seq` vs the log's end | a store SHORTER than the savepoint. Mostly caught by the two above, and checked on its own because a fold resumed past the end of a file is the one state no later read recovers from. |
| `prefix_sha` | an entry BELOW the savepoint's seq that changed after it was folded. The three checks above read the log's identity, its front and its length, and none of them reads the consumed prefix -- so without this one a savepoint and a cold fold disagree in exactly one case, and the savepoint is the answer that looks clean. `store._iter_entries` documents that a damaged interior line is SKIPPED on purpose, so a cold fold silently omits that entry while the savepoint keeps the value it folded. The digest is over the RAW RECORD BYTES of the consumed prefix, so it catches a rewritten line, a newly damaged one, and a newly readable one alike. It is checked TWICE on a read that resumes: once before the pass, and again after it, because the pass consumes entries above the prefix and damage landing in between would otherwise leave the served state carrying a record the file no longer yields. The second check is the same one -- `checkpoint.resumed_prefix_still_verifies` re-runs the load rather than re-implementing the comparison -- and a mismatch retries cold through the same path an identity change uses. |

**The identity is also read AFTER the pass, and a change discards the fold.**
`iter_from` opens the log by NAME, so a unit removed and recreated between the
identity read and the read of the entries hands the fold a different file's
entries while it holds the first file's state -- and the seqs do not say so,
because a recreated log starts its own again. `fold_session` therefore folds once
more from scratch, and on a second change reports `origin: None`, which is
"unknown identity": it is what stops a caller reusing the bundle and stops it
being written, since both compare against that field and neither accepts `None`.
The value is still served, because refusing to render a session that exists is the
worse answer.

That after-check is only as good as the identity it compares, so `log_origin` reads
BOTH signals from the file on disk: the file's device and inode, and its `createdAt`
through `store.unit_header_created_at`, which parses the header line itself. Neither
comes from the handle's own parsed header. That header is read once when the handle
is opened, so a handle held across a recreation would keep reporting the retired
file's stamp -- leaving device and inode as the only live signal, and those agree
whenever the new file lands on the freed inode, which is the common case rather than
a rare one. An earlier revision of this section said the savepoint FILES were exempt
because `load` and `save` hold a freshly opened handle. That was wrong: both take
the handle their caller passes, which is the handle `fold_session` folds with, so
the disk read is what protects them too.

**The prefix digest is what makes "a consumed entry cannot change" checkable rather
than assumed, and it is affordable because folding is not the same work as reading.**
`CrewLog.raw_prefix_digest` walks the unit's segments in the order
`segment_paths` gives them, skips each segment's header record, and hashes the next
`prefix_records` raw records. Three things follow from doing it that way. It decodes
no JSON, which is the point: on the log section 7 measures, hashing the whole prefix
is 20.6 ms against a 184.4 ms cold fold of all five projections. That ratio is the
weaker of the two honest readings, though, because a cold fold is not the read the
guard runs on. On a RESUME it is not a rounding error: the digest is verified on the
way in and rechecked after the pass, which is why an otherwise idle resume spends
44.8 ms almost entirely on two hashes, and a resume that also earns a write resolves
the record count and hashes again -- 66.6 ms for `prefix_witness`, 20.6 ms for the
recheck -- and lands at 197.1 ms, about what folding cold costs. The savepoint still
wins on the reads that dominate, the ones with nothing or little to fold, but by
roughly 1.7x to 4x rather than by an order of magnitude. An earlier revision of this
section quoted 343.6 ms for that cold fold and called the guard 6% of it; that figure
disagreed with section 7's own measurement of the same log, and both are replaced by
the one run quoted there. The boundary it is handed is a RECORD count,
and the FOLD resolves that count, from the last seq it read before its pass, through
`CrewLog.raw_records_through`, which is the one place a seq is read. And the framing is
the store's own rather than a second copy in the savepoint module, because this is the
path that decides whether damaged bytes are trusted.

**The digest is read BEFORE the pass, and the write persists that reading instead of
taking one of its own.** A digest read at write time covers whatever the file holds
THEN, which need not be what the fold consumed: a consumed record that changed in
between would be hashed together with state folded from its earlier value, and because
the recorded digest and the recorded state would then agree with EACH OTHER, every
later resume would recompute those same changed bytes, match, and serve state a cold
fold disagrees with -- for the life of the unit, since nothing rechecks a digest that
verifies. So `_fold_attempt` reads it through `checkpoint.prefix_witness` before it
consumes anything, `held_still` asks `checkpoint.prefix_unchanged` once the pass is
done, and `save` writes the value it was handed. A pass that ends at some other
boundary, because the file grew under it or because the handle's own seq was stale,
matches no fold in the bundle and writes nothing: that costs the savepoint, never the
answer the read serves.

**Only a read that folded the prefix ITSELF may write a savepoint, so an incremental
read serves from its caller's bundle and persists nothing.** The custody the paragraph
above describes has to reach across calls as well as across a pass. A read that resumed
from DISK carries it transitively: the savepoint records the digest its own writer read
before folding, and `checkpoint.resumed_prefix_still_verifies` checks that recording
again, so the digest on disk is still evidence about the bytes the state came from. A
`since=` bundle carries no digest -- `SessionProjections` has no such field -- and the
bytes below its seq were consumed by a call that has already returned, so nothing the
new pass can read is evidence about them. A digest taken then would be honest about the
file and wrong about the state beside it, which is exactly the pairing that makes a
wrong answer permanent. So `_fold_attempt` takes no witness on that path, and `save`
writes nothing without one. The cost is that a hot incremental reader -- the dashboard
push loop in `dashboard/handlers/crew_log.py`, whose `MAX_CACHED_SESSIONS` bundles are
folded with `since=` on every publish -- brings its savepoint forward on the next read
that folds the prefix instead of on every read, which is the lag the section below
already allows for.

An earlier revision of this section derived the boundary as `last_seq - first_seq + 1`
and justified it by saying the log is append-only with contiguous seqs, so a count
names the same boundary and a damaged line still occupies its slot. That was wrong,
and a reviewer caught it. A SUBSTITUTED damaged line does occupy its slot, but a blank
or unparseable line that the entry reader skips is still a record to the raw walk, so
the entry span and the record count diverge by one per such line. Handed the entry
span, the walk stopped that many records short, and the trailing records the fold HAD
consumed fell outside the digest -- where damage to them passed every guard, since
identity, first seq and length all still matched. `raw_records_through` decodes a
record per line, so only a fold that owes a write calls it; a savepoint is written
rarely, and the reader is handed the resolved count, which keeps verification
decode-free.

The honest cost of this, corrected after a reviewer caught the first version of this
sentence overclaiming: a savepoint saves the FOLD work, not the parse. `iter_from`
walks `_iter_segments` and drops entries below the requested seq AFTER constructing
them, so a resumed read that has anything to fold still decodes the prefix it skips
folding. What the digest adds on top is a second pass over the same bytes, hashing
only, which is why it is cheap next to folding and not free. The header record is
excluded because `origin` already compares creation identity and including it would
blur which guard fired. The three cheap checks stay in front of the digest even though
it would catch their cases too: they are O(1) comparisons, and a rejection should not
pay a pass over the whole file.

**A savepoint is allowed to LAG, and that is what keeps the write off the hot
path.** One is written only once the bundle has advanced `MIN_ADVANCE_ENTRIES`
past what is on disk; resuming from an older one replays the tail and reaches the
same value. Without the threshold the push would rewrite five files each time a
session grew by one entry, which is the cost this removes rather than relocates.
It also means a short session leaves no file at all: folding it from the start is
already cheap. `SessionProjections.saved_seq` carries what is on disk, so a caller
reusing a bundle decides from what it holds instead of reading the files to find
out.

**The payload is ASCII-only.** A crew log's own JSON admits a lone surrogate, so a
fold can retain one in a label -- and a serializer that passes it through makes the
UTF-8 encode raise out of a function that promises never to. Escaping every
non-ASCII character round-trips the surrogate and cannot fail, which is what the
store's own serializer does.

**No fsync.** A savepoint a crash leaves unpersisted is an older savepoint or no
savepoint, and both are answered by folding further, so a flush per write would
buy nothing the cold fold does not give for free. The rename is still atomic,
which is what keeps a reader from seeing half a payload.

**The write goes through the unit's lease, non-sole.** Nothing here needs
ownership to be correct against another READER: each file names the log and the
seq it describes, so any writer's version is a valid savepoint of the same
append-only bytes. Removal is the different case. It takes the lease `sole`, which
`acquire` refuses while any other hold exists, so holding a shared one across the
create, the write and the final check is what stops a removal starting in the
middle of them -- and a removal already in progress refuses the reader instead,
which is the answer that leaves the removal whole. Contention is a reason to skip,
never to wait: the read the fold was for is already served.

Two more rules close the ends the lease cannot. Establishing the identity stats
the newest segment, so a removed unit fails there -- BEFORE the lease, which would
otherwise create a lease file inside a directory removal has already emptied. And
after the write, a unit with no segment has everything just written deleted again,
the unit directory included: `atomic_write` creates its target's parents, so a
write that landed after a removal emptied the tree rebuilt that directory too, and
nothing else collects an empty one, because the retention sweep decides from a
unit's own entries and a unit with no segments has none.

The size cap is a BACKSTOP on section 2's bounds, not a bound itself: a fold that
grew unbounded state loses its savepoint instead of writing an unbounded file on
every read.

**Changing what a fold stores bumps `CHECKPOINT_VERSION`, and a test enforces
it.** `CHECKPOINT_VERSION` and `_state_matches_fold` both check the payload's
SHAPE, so the case neither sees is a fold whose MEANING changes while its keys do
not -- a counting fix in `usage` or `status` being the likely one. The old build's
savepoint then resumes onto the new logic, and the long sessions this exists to
speed up are the ones that keep serving pre-fix numbers for the life of the unit,
with no in-product way to retire the file because the tree is fenced from the
agent. So the rule is: any change to what a fold's `start` or `step` stores bumps
the version, which retires every savepoint to a cold fold at one refold each. The
rule is not left as this paragraph --
`test_changing_what_a_fold_stores_forces_the_savepoint_version_to_move` digests
each fold's stored state over a fixed script with the clock frozen, so a changed
fold reddens CI with the bump named in the failure. One global number over a
per-fold one is deliberate: it over-retires, and over-retiring costs a refold
while under-retiring serves a wrong number.

## 8. The pull-request holders -- the second fold across logs

`crew_log/holders.py`. The session tree above answers "who created whom". This
answers "which session is holding pull request X", and it is a separate reader
because neither the tree nor a single log's fold can answer it alone: the
question needs the references (a scan of prose) AND the lineage (the tree's
fold), combined under one rule.

**Why recency alone is wrong, and why the rule lives here.** A reader that takes
the session with the newest mention gets the wrong answer whenever a conductor is
involved: a conductor names the pull request every time it checks on the worker it
dispatched through `session_create`, so by recency it owns every row it supervises
and the worker actually holding the work is never named. Mention count does not
rescue it -- a conductor patrolling on a timer out-mentions a worker that pushed
twice. So the lineage is applied BEFORE the ranking (`fold_holders`, pure):

1. The candidates for a reference are the sessions whose text NAMED it.
2. Any candidate that is an ANCESTOR of another candidate is dropped. A conductor
   supervising a worker that named the same pull request is that worker's
   ancestor, so it leaves the running. A conductor that named a pull request NO
   descendant of its own named is NOT dropped: it is then the only session that
   knows about it, and reporting nobody would be worse than reporting the session
   that actually spoke.
3. The newest mention among the survivors wins, ties falling to the larger count
   and then to the slot key, so two scans of the same files agree.

Ancestry is the TREE's relation and not a second opinion about it: an edge is
followed only where `fold_tree` followed it -- onto a slot with a log of its own
-- and a slot the fold marked as lying on a cycle is never walked through. That is
why this module imports the tree instead of re-reading `session/opened`: two
readers with two folds would disagree about who created whom, and a person moving
between the pages that use them would see two answers. The answer carries the
owner's CITED creator even where the tree could not follow that citation, for the
same reason `TreeNode` retains it -- the citation is the child's own record, not
the fold's verdict on it.

**What counts as a reference.** Text entries only: `message/received.text`,
`message/sent.text` and `message/chunk.delta`. Tool arguments are hashed in this
store (section 2), so a pull request named only inside a tool call is not
recoverable from the log and is deliberately not guessed at. ONE spelling is read:
the full pull-request URL, whose `/pull/<number>` path says the number is a pull
request. The short forms are both refused. A bare `#number` names no repository,
and numbers are per-repository, so it would join a session to whichever repository
happened to share it. `owner/repo#number` names a repository and still does not
say what the number IS: the forge spells an issue and a pull request identically
in that form, and only an API call it cannot make could tell them apart, so
reading it would attribute a holder to an issue -- a reference to a pull request
that does not exist. A wrong kind, like a wrong owner, is worse than no answer.

The number must END its own path token, and the scheme must BEGIN one. The pattern
is applied to arbitrary prose and matches anywhere in it, so each end needs the
same boundary: without the trailing one, `/pull/123abc` -- which addresses no pull
request -- reads as a reference to 123, and without the leading one
`xhttps://github.com/o/r/pull/42`, an ordinary typo, matches one character in and
names a pull request the text does not address. One refused class covers both: the
characters that CONTINUE a token, being letters, digits, `_`, `-`, `~` and the `%`
of an escape. Everything else ends or leads a token and is not read, which keeps
`/pull/123/files`, `/pull/123#discussion_r1`, `/pull/123.diff`, a link at the end of
a sentence, and one led by a space, a bracket or a quote. The trailing refusal
includes a following DIGIT, so a run longer than the number bound cannot be re-cut
into a shorter valid number to satisfy the boundary: it arrives whole at the bound
that refuses it.

A repository's identity is CASE-INSENSITIVE at the forge, so owner and repository
are lowercased where a reference is constructed. That is one place rather than
two: normalising in the parser and again in each lookup lets a later call site
forget, and the failure is silent both ways -- two casings of one pull request fold
as two references, and a caller spelling it differently finds no holder for a
reference that was found.

A reference is stitched across an oversize body's slices. A body too large for one
line is written as a run of `message/chunk` entries (section 2), and a URL can
straddle any two of them, so scanning each slice alone loses it while reporting a
complete answer. Each slice therefore carries forward the tail of the slice before
it, `REFERENCE_STITCH_CHARS` of it, which is longer than the longest reference the
bounds below admit. The carry is kept with the segment's read position, so a scan
that stopped on its byte budget resumes the stitch rather than dropping the pair it
stopped between. It is reset at every record that does not continue the same run --
a different `turn` or `step`, an entry of another type, the citing entry itself --
because two unrelated bodies joined end to end could spell a reference that
neither of them contains, and a fabricated holder is the same defect as a lost one
wearing the other sign.

A run of slices with NOTHING after it is held rather than folded. The store writes a
body's slices and the entry citing their seqs as one group, so a run with anything
after it was completed, and a TRAILING run is a group whose citing entry never
landed -- `store._orphan_chunk_offset` calls exactly that run unreachable and drops
it, because no entry names those seqs and the message the body belongs to has no
record at all. Folding it would report a holder for a message with no record, and
report it complete. The run is HELD and not discarded: its references accumulate
apart from the segment, and they are kept ACROSS scans rather than for the duration
of one read, so a scan that caught a group mid-write folds it on the next call.
Discarding would lose an ordinary oversize body's references for good, which is a
worse answer than the one the hold prevents; rewinding the read position to the
run's first slice instead would stall the scan outright, because a body can be
larger than a whole scan's byte budget and every later scan would re-read the same
bytes without ever reaching the citing entry. The position advances past a held
run; what is held is what it contributed.

A record this reader SKIPPED does not close a run. A damaged but terminated line
carries no type, so it says nothing about whether the citing entry landed, and
treating it as the end of the group commits exactly the unreachable slices the hold
is for.

Each name is bounded too, at the forge's own limits (39 characters for an
owner, 100 for a repository), and that bound is a RETENTION bound rather than a
parsing nicety: a reference is cached for as long as its segment exists and the
cache bounds only the COUNT per segment, so without it one entry of untrusted
prose is a single 60 KiB reference and a segment's worth would pin tens of
megabytes in a scanner every reader shares.

**Bounds.** Unlike the tree, this reader cannot answer from a log's head, because
a reference can be named on any line. It is bounded by RESUMING instead. Each
segment's read position is cached with that segment's identity, so an untouched
segment costs one `stat` and a live session's appends cost only the bytes
appended -- `SCAN_BYTES_PER_SEGMENT` of them per scan, so a cold log of any size
is absorbed over several scans rather than blocking one. A scan that left bytes
unread says so, so a partial answer never reads as a complete one, and the unit
listing is the tree's own capped listing, so the two readers admit the same
population. That completeness flag travels IN the reading the scan returns
(`ReferenceReading`, `HolderReading`) and is computed under the same lock that
produced the data. It is deliberately not a property of the scanner: one scanner
instance serves every reader in the process, so a flag read in a second, unlocked
call could be another reader's, and a truncated answer would then be handed over
labelled complete. Over the unit cap counts as incomplete for the same reason a
byte budget does -- a truncated set of units and a truncated set of bytes both
mean the answer is not the whole store. A store fault is reported as an empty
answer that is incomplete, because "nothing was readable" and "nobody holds
anything" are different facts and only the second is safe to render. The same rule
runs one level down: a unit whose segments could not be listed, a segment whose
bytes could not be read, and a header that could not be read all make the reading
incomplete, while a header that WAS read and refused does not, and neither does a
segment retention deleted off the front -- its entries are gone from the store, so
an answer without them is complete.

A fault must never arrive as an ABSENCE, and the store's own helpers are where that
happens. A segment whose `stat` FAILS is the same rule at file level: the listing
just returned it, so the file is there and could not be read. Only
`FileNotFoundError` is the absence -- retention took the entries with it -- and every
other error is a fault. Asking `exists()` instead answers False for both, reporting a
readable-but-unread segment as one retention removed.

An announce record that is THERE and unreadable is the same rule in the lineage
fold: what it said about the session's creator is unknown rather than absent, and a
missing creator edge is the one shape that stops the ancestor rule dropping a
supervising conductor. The verdict is CACHED -- the log is append-only, so those
bytes cannot become readable and re-reading them every scan buys nothing -- and it is
served as a fault every time, which a cached absence would not be.

The store REFUSING to name a unit is the same fault, and it costs that unit alone.
The refusal is not an `OSError`, so it left the reference fold entirely and the outer
guard answered with no holders at all -- one unreadable unit throwing away every
healthy unit's work. It is reachable two ways. A header can hold an id the store will
not address, since a unit directory is named with a readable fold of the id plus a
digest of the whole of it and the fold turns a path separator into `_`, so a
hand-written directory and header can agree on the name while the id stays unusable.
And the root itself can be refused, for a data home this process may not read, which
has nothing to do with the id.

EVERY segment's own header is checked against the unit holding it, not just the
oldest. A segment's session is otherwise taken from the DIRECTORY, so a file whose
header names another session has its entries folded into this one's mentions while the
reading calls itself complete -- a holder for work the session never touched. The
oldest segment is already refused that way when its id does not fold back to its
directory, which is what leaving the rest unchecked made uneven. The check reads the
header from the same open file as the records rather than from a second look at the
path, since a separate read leaves a window in which the file the header vouched for
is not the file whose records are folded. A refusal is permanent, like a record that
could not be delivered: the answer is a property of the bytes, so re-reading reaches
the same one. A first record still being WRITTEN never reaches the check -- it has no
terminator, so the read stops on it as an append in flight.

Ancestry is walked to a bound of the NUMBER OF NODES, which is the longest simple
path there can be, and repeats are refused separately. A fixed floor is wrong in the
one direction that matters: a chain deeper than it stops the walk, the candidate is
not recognised as an ancestor, and it survives the descendant filter to win on
recency -- a wrong holder on an answer that still calls itself complete.

A fault is reported by the read that FAILED, never by a second look. `unit_dirs`
returns whether its listing failed alongside what it listed, and both folds take that
flag: a reader of its own cannot stand in for it, because `iterdir` yields as it goes,
so an error surfacing after the first entry escapes any probe that draws one entry and
stops, and even a full re-listing answers for a different moment than the listing did.
Whatever the listing had in hand is returned WITH the fault rather than discarded:
those directories were read, and the flag says the answer is short.

An ABSENT root is not a fault: a store with no sessions directory holds no sessions,
and an answer without them is the whole truth. A root the store REFUSES is one,
because resolving it is itself a read, and the refusal happens inside the listing
call, so it arrives as that call's own fault.

The same rule holds one level down, where `oldest_segment` answers an unreadable unit
directory with the value it gives a unit that has no segment. Both folds probe there,
on the empty path only so the ordinary case pays nothing, through one shared helper --
two copies of that judgement would be the two folds disagreeing again.

A header that could not be READ is the same rule one layer in, and the cache is
what gives it teeth. `read_head` answers an over-cap or unparseable line 1 with the
same "no header" it gives a file whose header has not been written yet, and that
second case is an ordinary transient: the emitter creates the file and appends the
opening record in two writes, so a read can land between them. The tree CACHES its
per-unit verdict, so blurring the two turns one damaged header into a silent
omission re-served on every later scan for as long as the file's identity holds.
The two are told apart by asking whether the file holds any BYTES, and a faulted
header is not cached at all. A header that parsed and was then refused is neither
case: it was read, and the refusal is the answer it gave.

Segments missing off the FRONT and missing from the MIDDLE are different facts.
Retention deletes whole segments off the front, and those entries are gone from
the store, so an answer without them is the whole truth available and is complete.
A segment gone from the middle is damage: the entries around it are still here, so
the sequence itself says some are absent, and the store puts each segment's
first-seq in its NAME so a reader can tell the two apart from the listing alone.
Seq runs contiguously inside one segment, so the segment following one whose
highest entry is `max_seq` must start at `max_seq + 1`; a higher start is the
hole, and the reading says incomplete. The number is read from the entries this
scan already framed rather than derived from a count of them, because only the
records know how the writer numbers a segment's header -- a count-based rule
reported an ordinary rollover as damage, which is worse than the hole it finds.
A segment this scan did not finish is not judged at all: its highest seq is short
by whatever went unread, and not finishing already makes the reading incomplete.

This reader asks the framing layer for records INTACT, and stops a segment at the
first one that cannot be delivered. The alternative -- a reader that skips such a
record -- drops it in full, terminator included, so its bytes never reach the scan
and cannot appear in what the scan counts as consumed. Any position cached past it
is short of the record, and every later scan reads the records after it again and
adds their mentions a second time, inflating the very count the fold breaks ties
on. There is no trustworthy position to cache past a record the reader never saw,
so the segment contributes nothing, the reading says incomplete, and the segment is
not read again: the abort repeats identically, and the log is append-only, so
nothing ahead of that record will ever be rewritten. The writer refuses to produce
an over-cap record, so reaching this at all means the file was written by something
else.

The question "was this unit retired between the scans" is asked of the UNIT, never
of its slot. A slot present in the lineage says only that SOME unit holds it now,
and a slot is reused the moment a new session takes the vacancy, so a probe keyed
on the slot skips exactly the retirement it is looking for whenever the vacancy was
filled -- which in Crew Mode is the normal case rather than the exception.

The window is applied on the way OUT and never while caching. A read position
advances on the bytes CONSUMED, not on the records kept, so filtering while
caching would step past a record without storing it and no later scan could
recover it -- one windowed call would permanently hide those references from every
unwindowed reader sharing the scanner, and report the result as complete.

For the same reason there is NO per-call narrowing of which entry types are
scanned. `since` needs no extra cache key, because a moment is already stored per
reference, so it can be applied on the way out. An entry-type filter cannot: the
cache stores a reference, not the type that produced it, so narrowing on the way
out would need the cache keyed by type and triple what it retains, and narrowing
the SCAN instead would poison the shared cache exactly as a cached window would.
`TEXT_TYPES` is always what is read.

A unit RETIRED between the two scans is the one race the flags above do not cover,
because neither half faults. Its mention is captured by the reference scan while
its lineage node is missed by the later one, and a mention with no node is the one
shape that defeats the ancestor rule -- the candidate cannot be dropped as anyone's
descendant, so a supervising conductor survives the filter and wins on recency.
A missing node alone does not establish it, since the ordinary cause is a log with
no `session/opened` record at all; what separates them is whether the unit is still
there. So the probe is one existence check per mentioning slot that has no node,
usually none at all. Reordering the two scans is not the fix it appears to be:
taking the lineage first trades a retirement for a unit ADDED in the same window,
which leaves the same shape, and a session appearing is constant while a retention
deletion is rare.

The cache is validated exactly as the tree's
head cache is and for the same reasons: the store never rewrites a written line,
so bytes already read are immutable while the segment exists, and `(st_dev,
st_ino)` alone is not an identity because a filesystem hands a freed inode number
to the next file it creates. A segment SHORTER than the position we read to is not
the file we read, whatever its inode says. A frame with no terminator is the tail
of an append in flight: it is neither parsed nor counted, so the next scan reads
those bytes again once they are complete.

The completeness a holder answer carries is BOTH scans': this section's references
and section 6's lineage. The lineage half matters more here than anywhere else the
tree is read. A lineage read that faulted drops one unit's creator record silently,
so a conductor stops being recognised as its worker's ancestor, the ancestor rule
stops dropping it, and the conductor -- which by recency almost always wins -- is
reported as the holder. That is a confident WRONG owner rather than a missing one,
and it is why the tree reports the completeness of its own scan
(`SessionTree.reading`) rather than only its nodes. `snapshot` keeps returning the
nodes alone for the pages that render lineage as decoration, where a missing edge
reads as "no creator known" and costs nothing.

**The readers.** Both are synchronous and blocking by construction: they list
directories and read files. A caller on an event loop hands the scan to a worker
thread. The scanner guards its own state with a lock, so nothing further is needed
to share one instance between callers.

## 9. Deliberately not here

- **A savepoint that survives a segment rollover.** `origin` carries the newest
  segment's inode, so a log that rolls over retires its savepoints once. No writer
  creates a second segment today, and whoever adds one has to revisit `log_origin`
  anyway -- the in-memory bundle reuses the same identity and has the same
  weakness. The cost of leaving it is one cold fold per rollover.

- **An app-facing grant for the holder projection.** A `permissions.prHolders`
  key and an `AppContext` reach would be public app-kit schema: once released a
  third-party manifest may declare it, so the payload shape is fixed from that
  moment and a first consumer wanting a different one gets a version rather than a
  fix. No in-tree consumer exists yet, so nothing would exercise the shape it
  committed to. The grant lands with the first consumer that reads through it,
  where the shape is answerable rather than guessed.
- **A savepoint on disk for THIS fold.** Section 7's savepoints carry a fold's
  state beside the log it came from; this scan's state is a per-segment read
  position and reference set held in memory and keyed by session, which is
  already the shape such a file would carry, so persistence stays additive.
- **Crew-kind folds.** No crew writer exists.
- **Subagent lineage and fork pointers.** A `subagent/spawned` entry's `ref` is
  resolved on the page like any other citation. The session tree (section 6)
  folds the `session_create` edge only: a `spawn_run` subagent has no session
  log of its own to record a parent on, and a fork stamps no creator.
- **SPA rendering.** The frame shape is specified here so the client can follow.
- **`turn/completed` carrying `attempt`.** It does not, so a fold cannot pair a
  completion with its start by field. The pairing is positional: a `turn/started`
  opens the current attempt at that ordinal and the next `turn/completed` for it
  closes whatever is open, which is what the file supports.
