# CI and the review gates

What runs on a pull request, what each gate is for, and how they fold into one
verdict. The source of truth is `.github/workflows/`; this doc explains the
shape and the rationale.

The `prepare-pr` skill
(`src/kiro_crew/builtin_skills/kirocrew-dev/prepare-pr/SKILL.md`) is the agent
side of this: it drives a working tree to review-ready by working with these
gates. Its phase flow, exit-code contract and PR-description contract live in
that skill, not here. Its portability design is
[../request-for-change/rfc-prepare-pr-portability.md](../request-for-change/rfc-prepare-pr-portability.md). The human release process
is [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Agent repair routing

For Kiro Crew PR CI AI comments, agents MUST load and execute
[prepare-pr's Review repair routing](../../src/kiro_crew/builtin_skills/kirocrew-dev/prepare-pr/SKILL.md#review-repair-routing).
That section is the one canonical contract, and its table is the only place the
repair-family preference order is written; this doc does not restate it, and
`test/test_review_repair_routing_skill.py` pins that table on purpose because it
records a requested execution policy. The reason for the policy lives in
prepare-pr's `references/rationale.md`.

The boundaries that matter here: the preferences are prose, not CI models, config
defaults or profile fields; the delegate implements, tests and self-reviews the
minimal fix, and the parent verifies, consolidates and publishes only with user
authorization; a missing model-pinned delegation facility is a blocker, never a
parent self-fix presented as delegation; a catalogue entry or accepted pin is not
proof of service, so an unverified served model is reported as such. The CI
workflows and the base-ref profile's read-only local reviewer semantics stay
unchanged. Worktree-dev and babysit point to this contract; general monitoring
does not depend on the Kiro Crew repository or on prepare-pr being installed.

## Shape

CI is a **fan-out of independent workflows that one aggregator folds into a single
verdict**, with exactly one ordering edge inside it: the cheap blocking
gates run in their own workflow, and both the expensive matrix and the fork
reviewers wait for its verdict rather than racing it.

```

Three structural facts explain most of the rest:

- **The cheap gates decide whether the expensive ones get to run.** The
  gates in `Fast Gate` cost 198 job-seconds between them, about 70% of which is
  runner acquisition and checkout, and they finish in ~44 seconds because they run
  in parallel. A median CI run is 240 job-minutes and 54 minutes of wall clock, and
  the `backend-test` shards alone are 73.7% of those job-minutes. While the
  gates lived in `ci.yml` the matrix started alongside them, so a gate that went red
  in twenty seconds still let the whole matrix run to completion. They are now a
  separate workflow with the same triggers, and `ci.yml`'s `await-fast-gate` job —
  which every heavy job needs — is the edge that makes a red gate SKIP the matrix
  instead of racing it. A `needs:` edge cannot cross a workflow file, which is why
  that barrier is a job that reads the other workflow's run rather than a
  dependency GitHub resolves for us.
- **The real merge gate is human approval plus armed auto-merge.** `PR Readiness`
  is the one status worth watching; individual red checks are strong signals a
  human can weigh.
- **A fork PR is aggregated like any other and can reach a passing readiness
  state**; CodeQL is the one lane it cannot run. See [Fork PRs](#fork-prs).

Out-of-band lanes that never gate a PR:

- **Release and publish**, tag- or schedule-triggered: `release.yml`,
  `nightly.yml`, the reusable `build-wheel.yml` / `build-desktop.yml` /
  `build-windows.yml`, `sign-and-notarize.yml`, `publish-cli.yml`,
  `publish-linux.yml`, `publish-docker.yml`, `publish-installer.yml`,
  `pages.yml` (the marketing site in `site/`, path-scoped so it never runs for
  backend or dashboard changes).
- **Verification that is too slow or too expensive for a PR:** `ota-test.yml`
  builds two real app bundles and performs an actual update swap, because the
  Electron unit suite stops at the `autoUpdater` handoff and never proves a real
  bundle is replaced on disk and relaunches.
- **The ratchet verdict `main` otherwise never gets:** `main-ratchet-audit.yml`
  re-runs only the cheap ratchet, ceiling and baseline gates on every push to
  `main`. Two things make a push to `main` unable to answer for them in `ci.yml`:
  GitHub keeps one *pending* run per concurrency group, so on a busy `main` each
  run is evicted before its slower lanes report and a commit's checks end up
  `cancelled` rather than `failure` — which is not a red X, so `main` looks green
  while drift accumulates; and the lint lanes are surface-gated, so a
  backend-only merge *skips* the eslint ceiling outright. This lane's group is
  keyed on the SHA so no push can supersede an earlier push's audit, it runs both
  surfaces unconditionally, and it reconciles one `ratchet-audit`-labeled tracking
  issue — opened on drift, commented on each further drifting push, closed on the
  next all-green one. Because per-SHA groups let audits for different commits
  finish out of order, only a run whose commit is still `main`'s head writes to
  that shared issue: a slow green audit would otherwise close the live drift
  record a newer push just opened. An unreadable head resolves toward keeping
  drift visible in both directions — still recorded on drift, still not closed on
  green. Every gate step runs on `!cancelled()` rather than the default
  `success()`, so one drifting ratchet does not skip the rest and reduce the
  verdict to whichever gate is listed first; and the set of gate scripts is
  pinned equal to `ci.yml`'s `backend-lint`, because a gate *added* there and not
  mirrored here would never be measured on `main` at all. Two further details are
  load-bearing. It sets
  `RATCHET_SCOPE_WHOLE_TREE`, because the four diff-scoped gates
  (`scripts/ratchet_scope.py`) would otherwise resolve an EMPTY diff on a push to
  the branch they measure against and pass by judging nothing; and it *reads* the
  eslint ceiling out of `ci.yml` rather than transcribing it, because a second
  copy would keep granting the old budget after a burn-down and report green on a
  tree the PR gate reds. It deliberately does not touch `ci.yml`'s concurrency or
  add a second full run: full serialization or a merge queue is a runner-budget
  call, and `test-durations.yml` already pays for a full suite on `main`.
  Contributor-facing half: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Maintenance:** `ship-report.yml` (a scheduled Slack summary),
  `test-durations.yml` (re-measures `.test_durations` so pytest-split's shards stay
  balanced by recorded runtime, and opens a PR with the update), `issue-triage.yml`
  (a model picks `type:` / `area:` / `platform:` labels from the repository's own
  live label set, because keyword rules mislabel often enough to be worse than no
  label), `issue-summary.yml` (a second, deliberately separate lane posts ONE
  comment per new issue: the report restated for a maintainer, the information
  still missing, and the recent issues most likely to be duplicates. Split from
  triage because publishing prose gives a prompt injection an audience that the
  label path does not have — so this lane, and only this lane, carries the
  markdown neutralizer and the candidate-pool intersection that stop an issue
  body from minting a `#N` reference or a mention. It gets no checkout on
  purpose; grounded, file-level investigation is Issue Radar's Investigate
  button, not a CI comment), `pr-merge-conflict-label.yml` and `fork-pr-label.yml`
  (both mirror a fact GitHub does not surface in the `/pulls` list onto a label), and
  `add-contributor.yml` (a daily cron, plus manual dispatch, adds each merged
  PR's author AND the reporters of the issues that PR closed to the README
  Contributors block via
  `scripts/update_contributors.py`; because the default branch is protected it
  opens a rolling PR rather than committing directly, like `test-durations.yml`.
  A login in `.github/contributors-optout.txt` is never added, which keeps the
  README's removal promise enforceable against the full-rebuild collector).
  One paginated GraphQL sweep over `pullRequests(states: MERGED)` drives it,
  reading each node's `author` and its `closingIssuesReferences` authors. The
  reporter side is deliberately keyed on that link rather than on listing
  `/issues`: the connection is populated only when a PR declares it closes the
  issue, and only merged PRs are scanned, so an entry is evidence the report
  changed the product — which keeps duplicates, invalid reports and
  credit-farming issues out. It undercounts by design (a fix that omitted the
  closing keyword is invisible), and the remedy is the manual `--login` path, not
  loosening the rule. Dedup is two-layered: `sort -u` over the union, because
  someone can be both a PR author and a reporter, then the script's own README
  scan. The same block also holds contributors whose contribution left neither
  trace — a review, a translation, a private security report — added with
  `scripts/update_contributors.py --login`. Those entries survive every later run
  because the collector only ever inserts and never rewrites an existing line;
  that preservation is what makes one shared list workable instead of a second
  table.

  Note that opening that rolling PR is best-effort. This repository leaves
  "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" off — one switch
  covers creating AND approving, and `main`'s merge gate is a required review — so
  `gh pr create` with `GITHUB_TOKEN` is refused with `GitHub Actions is not
  permitted to create or approve pull requests`. It only bites after the previous
  rolling PR merged and its branch was deleted; while the PR is open, pushing to
  the branch is enough. The push happens first either way, so a refusal is a
  handoff, not a loss: the job stays green and files/updates one issue titled
  "Add Contributor needs a human to open the contributors PR" carrying the compare
  link. The same limitation applies to every workflow here that opens a PR
  (`test-durations.yml`, `memory-benchmark.yml`), which carry the same guard in a
  lighter form: they emit a `::notice::` with the compare link and exit 0 rather
  than filing an issue, because their branches are regenerated on the next
  scheduled run and so do not need a durable tracker. Any create failure that is
  NOT that refusal still fails the job in all three.
  `test/test_workflow_pr_create_handoff.py` holds them in step and fails a new
  `gh pr create` step that skips the guard.

### Code ownership

`.github/CODEOWNERS` assigns every repository path to `@kirodotdev/kirocrew-team`
through a single wildcard rule. GitHub reads that file to request reviews; the file
itself establishes no approval count and enforces no branch protection, so a tier, a
required number of reviewers, or a designated-maintainer requirement cannot be
inferred from it. The wildcard rule carries the ownership declaration, and GitHub
branch protection stays the enforcement point for any required approval policy.
`fork-workflow-guard.yml` is what keeps a fork PR from editing the file (see
[Fork PRs](#fork-prs)).

## `fast-gate.yml`: the cheap blocking gates

Every job here is blocking, and nothing here is behind a path filter — the
workflow has no `changes` job at all, because a gate that costs a few seconds is
cheaper to always run than to decide about, and a filter is one more thing that can
be dodged by an edge case in its own globs.

All Fast Gate jobs select Python `3.12` through the SHA-pinned setup-python action
immediately after checkout, before any run step, on both fleet and hosted runners.
The pin selects the minor series, not one patch release. Stdlib-only gates still
need the project's supported grammar: Comment History, Loop-Bound Locks and Memory
Store Seam parse repository source, including Python 3.12 f-strings. An older
parser can reject valid source or silently miss findings. The repository-owned
prepare-pr profile starts its repeated checks with a pure runtime preflight that
prints the active Python version and executable and rejects versions below the
project's `>=3.12` floor. It does not install or replace an interpreter; activate a
supported environment before running the checks. Local checks do not establish
which patch release executes in CI; retain the setup action's actual runtime log.

They live in their own workflow for two reasons that both come down to who has to
wait for them. `ci.yml`'s heavy jobs now wait through `await-fast-gate`, so a red
gate skips ~220 job-minutes of tests it was previously running beside. And the
`fork-*-review.yml` lanes need SOME trusted workflow to vouch for a fork's head
commit before they start (see [Fork PRs](#fork-prs)); waiting for all of `CI` put a
fork PR's AI verdict ~54 minutes out, when the gates that verdict actually needs are
green after one.

The trigger set is copied from `ci.yml` deliberately, `branches: [main]` included.
The fork reviewers key on this workflow now, so a wider filter here would newly
review fork PRs opened against a non-main base — which today get no review at all,
because they wait on a `CI` run that `ci.yml`'s own branch filter never starts.
Widening that is a separate decision from moving the gates.

| Job | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| `internal-content-scan` | Checks the lines a change ADDS against a marker list held outside this repo, fetched per run over OIDC. Its own workflow, not `fast-gate.yml`, because it needs credentials. **Blocking**: `PR Readiness` reads it, so an added internal marker fails readiness. A same-repo PR is scanned by `internal-content-scan-gate.yml`; a fork PR by the privileged Stage-2 `fork-internal-content-scan.yml`, which posts the same check name. `push` to `main` remains the backstop. See [oss-fork-boundaries](../system-specs/oss-fork-boundaries.md) |
| `vendor-manifest` | `scripts/verify_vendor_manifest.py`. Hashes every file under `src/kiro_crew/_vendor` against the committed `scripts/vendor_manifest.sha256` — the tree is excluded from semgrep and the AI reviewers' diff, so this checksum is its only content review. Hashing the ~26MB tree takes seconds, so it is always-on like the rest of this workflow |
| `brand-lint` | `scripts/check_brand_name.py`, self-test first. Fails on a newly added line that joins the two words of the product name. Diff-scoped: the tree still carries thousands of pre-convention prose lines, so a whole-tree gate would charge that backlog to whoever pushed next; the whole-tree count is still printed as a non-failing report |
| `focus-cue-lint` | `scripts/check_focus_cue.py`, self-test first. Fails when a change writes the `className` of an element that then has no visible focus cue. Diff-scoped for the same reason as `brand-lint`, and reports whole-tree |
| `feature-map-lint` | `scripts/check_feature_map.py`, self-test first. Fails when a file is ADDED or DELETED under `website/src/pages/` or `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/handlers/`, or a `<Route>` entry arrives or leaves `website/src/App.tsx`, while `docs/feature-map/README.md` stays untouched. The blocking root AUTOSDE rule `feature-map-correctness` is the semantic half: it verifies changed rows against the code, rejects unrelated or cosmetic map churn, and checks that the map's net diff matches the PR's stated scope. Structural on purpose: an edit to an existing page changes a feature's behavior, which the map does not describe, so an edit-only diff never fires — a gate demanding a map review on every UI fix produces a map nobody reads. Fails OPEN on an unreadable diff, unlike the other gates here: this one guards a documentation habit, not an invariant a bad line carries into `main` forever |
| `changelog-history` | `scripts/check_changelog_history.py`, self-test first. Fails when a shipped `CHANGELOG.md` section loses lines. Every section already in that file describes software a user has installed, and it has been silently truncated once already — a commit titled "docs: add 0.3.0-insider.9 changelog" REPLACED the file (53 insertions, 322 deletions) and nothing noticed until the Releases page had gone nearly empty |
| `builtin-skill-scope` | `scripts/check_builtin_skill_scope.py`, self-test first. Fails on a marker for THIS repository (its GitHub slug, a `src/` checkout path, a test or workflow file) inside a skill body under `src/kiro_crew/builtin_skills/`, because those install on every machine and resolve for exactly one of them. The `kirocrew-dev/` family is exempt by directory, since this repository is its subject matter |
| `loop-bound-locks` | `scripts/check_loop_bound_locks.py`, self-test first. Fails on any module-global `asyncio.Lock()`/`Event()`/`Queue()` declaration — those bind to the import-time (or first-use) event loop and raise `RuntimeError` when acquired from another loop (Python 3.10+). #4800 converted the tree to `kiro_crew.loop_lock.LoopBoundLock`; whole-tree, since the backlog is zero |
| `testpaths-coverage` | `scripts/check_testpaths_coverage.py`, self-test first. Fails on a `test_*.py` file outside the roots `setup.cfg` pins in `testpaths` — such a file is never collected, so it is green by omission and rots against the code it claims to cover (#6577 found twelve). Whole-tree, since the backlog is zero |
| `harness-parity` | `scripts/check_harness_parity.py`, self-test first. Fails on a newly added line that expresses "this is the Kiro harness" as the absence of another one — a shape that fails toward the permissive answer, so nothing else goes red. Diff-scoped; the whole-tree backlog is a non-failing report |
| `memory-store-seam` | `scripts/check_memory_store_seam.py`, self-test first, with `MEMSTORE_BASE_REF` resolved to the diff base. Enforces explicit store selection on added memory-context calls. The prepare-pr floor runs both commands; the main ratchet lane classifies this as a diff-only gate because its whole-tree backlog is a non-failing report |
| `docs-lint` | `scripts/docs_lint.py --test` then `scripts/docs-lint.sh`. Every internal link resolves, every doc is reachable from its directory index, every directory holding docs has one, no code comment cites a doc that does not exist, no doc cites a source LINE past the end of the file it names, no module spec names a source file that exists nowhere, and no doc whose filename is hardcoded in code has been renamed out from under its consumer. Four trees are walked: `docs/`, the packaged `src/kiro_crew/docs/`, `website/docs/`, and the markdown a builtin app ships under `src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/`. Plus the fact checks below, behind a shrink-only baseline |

Each of these runs its own self-test in the same step, ahead of the real check. A
gate that has silently stopped matching reads as a green signal, which is worse than
no gate, so every rule is exercised against a planted probe first.

### `docs-lint`'s fact checks sit behind a shrink-only baseline

The structural docs checks hold at zero and fail outright. A second family inside
the same gate asks whether a sentence is still TRUE of the code, and that question
has a backlog, so its findings are `(check-id, path, token)` triples matched
against [`.github/docs-lint-baseline.txt`](../../.github/docs-lint-baseline.txt).
A listed triple passes; an unlisted one fails.

| Check | What fails |
|---|---|
| `path-exists` | A backticked repo-anchored source path (`src/**.py`, `scripts/*.py\|.sh`, `website/src/**.ts\|.tsx`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `docs/**/*.md`) that names no file. Written from the repo root, so it resolves or the doc is wrong — the suffix index is still a fallback, because a skill's own `scripts/` is one root down. A `path::Symbol` coordinate stays checked, since this repo addresses its own code that way too; only the docs describing a run against another repository are exempt |
| `line-ref` | A `file.py:NNN` citation anywhere in prose. The beyond-EOF check catches the citation that already rotted; this catches the one that rots on the next refactor with nothing going red. Cite a symbol name instead |
| `fenced-path` | A `docs/task-specs/**/*.md` path or a `kirocrew run` argument inside a fenced block that names no file. A fence is a sample everywhere else, but a reader PASTES these two |
| `table-row-merge` | Two index rows glued onto one physical line. Both links resolve, so every link-graph check stays green while the table renders one row short and a file loses its entry |
| `code-coupled-completeness` | A packaged doc named in a string literal under `website/src` and absent from `CODE_COUPLED_DOCS`. An unrecorded coupling can be renamed apart silently |
| `dead-identifier` | A backticked identifier absent from every first-party code tree. **Report-only** unless `--strict-identifiers`, because the class mixes real rot with names the repo cannot adjudicate |

Three checks skip a doc whose genre names things that do not exist yet
(`docs/request-for-change/`, which carries the plans, and `docs/task-specs/`):
`path-exists`, `fenced-path` and `dead-identifier`. A proposal
names a file or a symbol precisely BECAUSE it is not there yet. `fenced-path` also
skips the packaged user docs under `src/kiro_crew/docs/`, where a task-spec path is
a template for the reader's own project rather than a file in this checkout.

The builtin app tree is the mirror image of that exemption: it keeps every fact
check and every link check, and drops only the two CURATION rules, reachability and
the per-directory index. A `SKILL.md` is a skill definition an agent loads verbatim,
so a rotted path in one misroutes the agent rather than a human reader, but an index
file in `skills/<name>/` would be a file the app never loads. `UNCURATED_PREFIXES` in
`scripts/docs_lint.py` is where that line is drawn, alongside the archives.

`python3 scripts/docs_lint.py --update-baseline` prunes the list, and it is
prune-only by construction: it intersects the recorded triples with the ones firing
now, so it cannot record one, and it refuses to run when the file is missing —
read as an empty set, one `rm` plus one refresh would accept every current
violation forever. Adding is the separate `--accept-new`, which prints every triple
it records so each exemption lands in a diff a reviewer reads. That is the same
posture `check_black_formatting.py` takes.

A triple that no longer fires is **reported, not fatal**. That is a concession to
several changes consolidating the doc trees at once, so an entry graduates in a file
the current change never touched; it is not a claim that a triple is fragile, since
the recorded identity omits the line number and a reflow keeps it.

## `ci.yml`: correctness

Every job here is blocking. Every job that costs real runner time also `needs:`
`await-fast-gate`, so on a red gate it does not run at all.

| Job | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| `changes` | "Detect changed surface". Resolves the path filters every other job reads, so a diff that cannot affect a surface does not pay for it |
| `await-fast-gate` | Polls the `Fast Gate` run for this exact head commit and **fails closed** in all three ways it can go wrong: a run that never appears (180s budget), one that never completes (720s budget), and one that completes non-success. A barrier that passed when it could not read its subject would be worse than none, because the matrix would run anyway and the log would claim it was cleared to. One extra ~1-minute job buys the whole matrix the right to not start |
| `backend-lint` | `isort --check-only`, `flake8`, `mypy` on Python 3.12, plus `scripts/check_black_formatting.py` — black enforced on every file outside `.github/black-baseline.txt`, which can only shrink — and `scripts/check_subprocess_encoding.py` (self-test first) — no text-mode subprocess call without an explicit `encoding=`, `**UTF8_TEXT`, or a `# subprocess-encoding: locale` marker, outside `.github/subprocess-encoding-baseline.txt`, which can only shrink — and `scripts/check_sync_io_in_async.py` (self-test first) — no blocking db / subprocess / http / `time.sleep` call inside an `async def` under `src/`, outside `.github/sync-io-in-async-baseline.txt`, which can only shrink. A stall past `dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs` (25s) makes the watchdog kill the gateway and drop every in-flight turn (#3057, #1572); the escape is an offload (`await asyncio.to_thread(...)`, or a named lane from `src/kiro_crew/executors.py`) or a `# on-loop-io-ok: <why it cannot block>` marker whose reason is mandatory. All four baselined gates in this job read their diff scope from the one shared resolver in `scripts/ratchet_scope.py`, so they cannot disagree about which lines a change added; the env-base gates (`check_brand_name.py`, `check_harness_parity.py`, `check_focus_cue.py`) share the same diff parsing through its explicit-base entry points while keeping their `*_BASE_REF` base semantics |
| `backend-test` | 8 whole-file shards on Python 3.12, assigned before import, `-n auto` within each; 60-minute job budget includes coverage upload, with the 120-second per-test timeout retained. Large CodeBuild compute with the non-root boundary for eligible actors; hosted fallback |
| `backend-test-windows` | All 8 whole-file shards use large CodeBuild compute for eligible actors, windows-latest otherwise; `--no-cov`, 180s per-test timeout. See the migration contract below |
| `backend-test-ipv6` | Five native IPv6 cases on hosted Linux and Windows; fail-closed report check, Linux full-run coverage merged with the ordinary shards |
| `backend-test-windows-fail-closed` | Same actor-gated Windows routing, single `-n0` run of `test/test_windows_fail_closed_optin.py` BY NODE ID with the pass count grepped, so a silent skip cannot go green. It boots a real gateway and drives one ACP prompt turn on Windows against real filesystem state |
| `backend-test-sandbox` | The one job that clears the AppArmor userns restriction, so the tests guarded by `skipif(not userns_available())` EXECUTE instead of skipping. Runs all eleven sandbox-dependent suites. The shards collect the same files — nothing is deselected — but there the sandbox-guarded tests skip, so this is the only lane where those 85 assertions (the `~/.kiro/crew` keystone among them) actually execute |
| `backend-test-crew-container` | "Backend Tests (crew container)". The only lane that runs the crew container image's suite (`aws_control/crew/runtime/container_tests/`, 327 tests). It is separate from the shards because it installs the image's own runtime pins (`container/requirements.txt`: fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, boto3), which that file's header forbids becoming dependencies of the application, and the shards' environment IS the application's, so there the suite's conftest collects nothing. Sets `CREW_CONTAINER_TESTS_REQUIRED=1`, which turns every reason that conftest would decline to collect into a hard error and checks the collection against the tree |
| `real-adapter-contract` | "Real Adapter Contract Tests". The one lane that INSTALLS the adapters the codex and opencode projections were measured against — `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` and `opencode-ai`, `npm ci` from the locked manifest in `test/real_adapters/` (its own manifest, not the product's; Dependabot bumps it weekly so drift shows up in the bump PR) — so the four contract tests that drive a real adapter execute instead of skipping. Everywhere else they skip, which left the element shape, the child environment, the refused transports and the eviction verb resting on one local run. Selects them by the `real_adapter` marker, so one added later is included rather than left out of a list. Sets `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1` — the repository's existing "this job declared its preconditions must hold" switch, shared with the E2E suites — which turns an absent adapter into a failure, and then asserts on the junit report that at least the known contracts ran and none was skipped, so a broken install cannot report a green lane that measured nothing |
| `coverage-combine` then `coverage-gate` | Combines the 3.12 shard data, then enforces the project line-rate floors, plus a per-file floor with a shrink-only baseline (all floors live in the job's `env:` block). **CodeBuild-hosted runner** (pilot, below) except for forks |
| `frontend-lint` | `tsc -p tsconfig.app.json`, `eslint` under a hard-zero warning ceiling, `jscpd`, and `npm run i18n:check` |

| `lockfile-engines-floor` | "Lockfile Installs On Declared Node Floor".

| `bundle-size` | "Bundle Size Gate". Builds the frontend with `--mode analyze` (which is the only build that emits `dist/bundle-report.json`) and then runs TWO checks over that one build: per-chunk ceilings from `website/scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs`, with a 500 KB default for any chunk not named there, and an acyclic-graph check from `website/scripts/check-chunk-cycles.mjs`. The job name is narrower than its scope on purpose — it is a required check, so renaming it would silently stop satisfying branch protection. **An acyclic chunk graph is a deliberate invariant and the cycle check has no allowlist**, unlike the size ceilings: a chunk cycle has no valid initialization order, so a body can run against a binding that is still uninitialized and blank the page before React mounts, and whether a given cycle does that is not decidable from the chunk graph. Fix the chunking rather than waiving it. Skipped on a backend-only diff, which cannot change the bundle |

The suite's disposable gateway takes `agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec` (seeded in `test/test_playwright_e2e.py`) because the fleet container refuses `CLONE_NEWUSER` at the runtime policy level and the agent binary is a stdlib echo stub; a sandboxed spawn doing real work stays proven by `e2e-private-namespace` and `e2e-boot-matrix` |

### Backend file sharding

The Linux and Windows matrices assign whole files before pytest imports their
items. `scripts/ci_file_shards.py` is an opt-in pytest plugin, loaded only by
those matrix commands. It uses SHA-256 of the root-relative POSIX path to choose
one of `SHARD_COUNT` owners. Each xdist worker reaches the same assignment.
Adding a file does not move existing files between shards.

Pytest still walks its configured roots, applies its filename patterns and
platform-specific conftest ignores, and creates its normal file collectors.
The plugin returns an empty collection report for files owned by another shard,
before their collector imports them. It does not rewrite discovery into explicit
file arguments, which would bypass `collect_ignore`. Within its owner, the
ordinary shard excludes only `ipv6_required`; the dedicated hosted lane runs those
items. Explicit reduced-scope targets keep their
existing discovery semantics and are partitioned at the same file boundary.
Leaf-test repeat runs do not load the file-sharding plugin and remain unsharded.

Both Linux and Windows backend commands opt into the existing payload-free
`scripts.ci_pytest_progress` recorder. Linux supplies it to full, reduced and leaf
invocations through a shell argument array, not inherited `PYTEST_ADDOPTS`.
A crashed worker is not restarted (`--max-worker-restart=0`): the shard stays
failed and may end before all selected tests finish, rather than losing its
failure report during replacement. This is fail-fast diagnosis, not successful
coverage or a repair of the crashing test. Periodic console records and best-effort
JSONL artifacts preserve evidence; job-level cancellation can prevent uploads.
Healthy selection, per-test timeouts and coverage selectors are unchanged.

The root conftest's import-time telemetry guard fails the offending module's
collection report on every worker, so pytest/xdist fails the job even when the
shard does not own `test_host_isolation_floor.py`. The process-wide telemetry-off
pin, per-module emitter attribution and recorder reset remain in force; a test
on one shard is not the enforcement point for other shards' collection state.

The union of the ordinary shards and hosted IPv6 lane must equal the original
suite, with no duplicates within each OS. Invalid shard options fail as usage
errors. A shard collecting no tests retains
pytest's nonzero exit; it never falls back to the whole suite or reports success.
`loadgroup` still serializes marked tests within a job. Like the former item
split, this is not a cross-runner serialization mechanism. Namespace jobs and
macOS keep their existing collection; `pytest-split` remains installed for macOS
and the optional duration-recording workflow.

This reduces repeated test-module imports and item collection. It does not avoid
shared conftest/package imports or imports made by another test. Hashing does not
balance duration, and one large test file is indivisible. The eight shards per OS
trade more runner slots and repeated setup for less work per shard. Keep runner
routing, timeout values and coverage gates fixed when comparing CI runs; report
the shard count alongside queue, collection and execution timings.
Use actual phase timing rather than buffered log timestamps to measure collection.
Full-suite throughput and the five-minute goal require remote evidence, not an
extrapolation from shard count. Full-run coverage combines ordinary shards with
the required hosted IPv6 artifact.

The Linux coverage command retains the `kiro_crew` and `sage_lib` package-name
boundary. It additionally selects only the AWS Control crew packaging directory
and the Sage tests directory: both contain source already included in that
boundary's reports, but synthetic builder module names and app-local fixture
imports can otherwise lose executed lines depending on import order. Selecting
all of `src/kiro_crew` instead also admits vendored libraries, standalone skill
scripts and container code outside the package-name boundary. No new exclusions
or baseline entries are needed; omit rules, branch measurement and floors stay
unchanged. Sage's path alias remains in place. Combined data can contain both
native separators and POSIX remapped keys: comparisons normalize separators,
while coverage queries use the exact recorded key and reject duplicate identities.

The coverage regression checks nonzero expected lines and equal branch arcs for
an unsharded run and four file shards, including exec variants and both Sage
import spellings. It stages each shard's data outside the active `.coverage.*`
glob, which pytest-cov erases at the next run's start. Variants compiled with the
original filename contribute to that file's coverage; this is not proof that each
recorded line ran in the unmodified variant. Whole-suite coverage and baseline
graduations still require the resulting CI artifact.

Rollback: replace the plugin and `--file-shards` / `--file-shard` flags in the
three matrix invocations with the previous `--splits` / `--group` flags. No
infrastructure, worker-count or privilege change is needed.

### Required native IPv6 tests

`ipv6_required` marks only tests whose native loopback contract needs `::1`.
The ordinary Linux and Windows shards exclude this marker in every invocation,
including hosted fallback, frontend-only scope and leaf gates/repeats. The
`backend-test-ipv6` matrix runs the marked population on `ubuntu-latest` and
`windows-latest`. No fleet network or privilege setting changes. Local pytest
has no default marker filter; macOS keeps its existing hosted selection.

Five nodes are routed: the three real DNS-rebinding tests in
`TestDnsRebindingIsRefused`, only the IPv6 parameter of
`test_native_tcp_peer_identifies_client_process_not_server`, and
`TestFindListeningPidsErrors.test_windows_finds_real_ipv6_loopback_listener`.
The IPv4 peer parameter, stable-host and off-event-loop DNS tests, and mocked
IPv6 tests stay in the ordinary shards. The listener test keeps its Windows-only
platform guard. Native bind failures remain hard failures, not capability skips.

The hosted lane asserts exactly five reported cases, with only the Windows-only
listener allowed to skip on Linux. It always runs this bounded population, even
on frontend-only diffs, and repeats it three times on leaf-test diffs. Ordinary
leaf corpus gates still run once. The collection contract compares actual pytest
nodes before routing with the disjoint ordinary-plus-hosted union and verifies
the affected files' shard owners.

Full-run Linux IPv6 coverage uses exactly the ordinary shards' two package names
and two bounded directory selectors. Windows remains trace-free. Frontend-only
and leaf runs remain coverage-free. Coverage Combine needs both test lanes and
explicitly downloads `coverage-ipv6`, separate from `coverage-shard-*`; it refuses
a missing `.coverage.ipv6` before combining. Coverage Gate always requires the
IPv6 matrix to succeed, including reduced and leaf runs. Failed, skipped or
cancelled upstream jobs cannot silently satisfy the gate. Floors, baselines,
omit rules and measured source boundaries stay unchanged. Local node and coverage
union tests do not establish hosted OS execution or remote artifact delivery.

### Linux and Windows CodeBuild migration

All eight `backend-test` shards use `linux_runner_large`; all eight
`backend-test-windows` shards and `backend-test-windows-fail-closed` use the
centrally resolved large Windows label. `e2e-boot-matrix` maps its Linux and
Windows legs to those outputs without changing `matrix.os`, names, timeouts or
artifact names. `backend-lint` uses large on the fleet. The formatter gate keeps
Black's original native CLI and default worker selection when `RUNNER_ENVIRONMENT`
is explicitly `github-hosted`; the CI step does not set `BLACK_NUM_WORKERS`.
Fleet and local checks use `scripts/bounded_black.py`, with at most eight workers
regardless of the native pool size. `scripts/ci_black_diagnostics.py` runs the gate
once, preserves its failure status and stderr, and records bounded cgroup readings
and child peak RSS. Worker count alone does not bound retained formatting trees:
[the env-only two-worker fleet run](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/actions/runs/35417525930/job/105829161045)
reached its 15,032,385,536-byte cgroup limit and incremented `oom_kill` from zero
to one before the recycling wrapper existed. Retirement after one file is what
bounds retention, so a worker's own peak does not grow with the pool and the
ceiling is set for wall time rather than for that accumulation.

The wrapper adapts the pinned native Black CLI to one file per spawned worker.
Native discovery, configuration, exclusions, caches and AST checks remain intact.
On Linux its launcher and workers have a 2 GiB per-process address-space ceiling;
local macOS and Windows retain recycling without that Linux-only ceiling. Incomplete
reports, cancellation, worker failures and launcher exceptions return 123, never
a partial formatting verdict. Per-process limits do not bound the whole job's
cgroup usage or guarantee that every future input fits. The repository-owned
prepare-pr profile keeps the bounded local path and diagnostic command. Ratchet
scope, graduates and prune-only baseline refresh remain unchanged.
`bundle-size` uses large for its 6 GiB heap.
Shard ownership, coverage selectors and floors stay unchanged. Five stale Windows
expected-failure entries are removed only after their six Bash syntax cases pass;
syntax checks select native Git Bash on Windows and Bash on POSIX. Recency tests
control module-local clocks, and purge tests evaluate real activity against an
explicit clock without relaxing future-time or retention refusals. Device-name
refusals check actual directory entries and write attempts, not `CON.exists()`.
Cache tests control both directory and file mtimes and retain real mutation checks.
These test preconditions do not promise production ordering under tied clocks.
Test commands route only `ipv6_required` items to the hosted lane described above.
This is one migration being validated, not eight already-proven shards
or a rollout conditional on three green canaries.

The CI workflow requires this repository, a push or an `opened`/`synchronize`
same-repository PR event, and
`contains(fromJSON(vars.CODEBUILD_ACTOR_IDS || '[]'), github.actor_id)`.
Other PR activities (including edits, reopens and labels) stay hosted even for
an admitted actor: that actor did not supply the code being run. The same
restriction applies to every inline PR route and both platform resolvers.
The same actor check covers the existing inline routes, including every
unconditional Fast Gate. Pages and the main ratchet audit also admit manual
runs from listed actors. The three non-agentic code-review checks use the PR
route; the merge-conflict label job and the reusable wheel/dependency-audit
jobs use the fleet only for push events, keeping scheduled/manual callers hosted.
Their steps, permissions and triggers are unchanged.

The repository variable is a JSON array of string actor IDs matching the fleet
webhook filter. The maintainer changing either fleet project's actor filter owns
updating `CODEBUILD_ACTOR_IDS` in the same operational change and verifying that
both projects and the routing mirror agree before declaring that change complete.
Missing/empty membership routes to hosted; a fork PR stays
hosted even when its actor is admitted. Every output consumer has a hosted
fallback. Removing the variable routes all these jobs back to hosted on new
runs, without changing tests or AWS resources. It does not reroute an already
queued job. The independent webhook filter remains necessary: routing is not a
credential boundary against a contributor who edits a workflow.

The existing projects were reported verified with Linux `standard:7.0` and
Windows `windows-base:2022-1.0`, MEDIUM defaults, no project environment
variables, privileged mode off, no reserved fleet, and matching actor filters.
The Windows label adds only `instance-size:large`; it invents no image override.
These manually managed resources still need reproducible infrastructure source;
this repository change grants no AWS permissions and provisions no resources.

Linux setup actions retain the runner identity. `run-as-runner` then hands only
the workspace to the test user and supplies jq 1.7.1, lsof and toolcache libpython
resolution. The root-owned runner temp is sticky 1777, never recursively chowned;
file-command files remain unwritable by the test user. Tests and shard coverage
staging use ci-shell; scope selection keeps the default shell because it writes
`GITHUB_OUTPUT`. Hosted uses a bash passthrough. The boot matrix selects its
shell in job-level `defaults.run` from `matrix.os`; step-level shells are literal.
Dependency installation explicitly uses bash under the runner identity before
ci-shell is provisioned. Before Bash starts, the CodeBuild boundary resets only
inherited SIGINT ignore state; UID/EUID and other signal dispositions are unchanged.
It verifies the existing `/dev/shm` is tmpfs and designates it only for the two
kernel-owner lock tests. Those fixtures create private temporary homes and remove
them afterward; ordinary tests retain their normal temporary directories. No mount,
permission or file-command ownership is changed. Overlay inode mismatch was measured;
tmpfs fixes that identity mismatch but does not guarantee dead-acquirer visibility.
The ordinary orphan test observes the live acquirer before releasing and reaping it,
then independently verifies continued flock contention and complete inode-matched
kernel records. Only a positively observed blank/owner-0 record with no named-owner
record permits the existing honest unknown-owner refusal. Read errors and conflicting
records fail; a production lookup returning `None` alone never selects that branch.

The permanent hosted exception `backend-test-kernel-lock-owner` runs the same live-
holder and orphan cases on an uncontainerized `ubuntu-latest` runner, with no designated
lock root and `KIROCREW_LOCK_OWNER_STRICT=1`. It requires the exact dead acquirer, rejects
environmental returns, and validates both JUnit identities with zero skips or failures.
The ordinary fleet still runs both cases. Full-scope coverage uses the same four
selectors, uploads `coverage-kernel-lock-owner`, and requires
`.coverage.kernel-lock-owner` before combining alongside the shards and IPv6 data.
Coverage Gate requires the strict lane's success in full, reduced and leaf scopes;
missing artifacts or failed, cancelled or skipped execution cannot satisfy it.
Native hosted and fleet success must still be established by actual CI logs.

The boot matrix uses the same
boundary on Linux, where its rich fixture asserts a named namespace refusal
when the real backend is unavailable rather than skipping the test.

Windows checkout is followed by a CodeBuild-only inventory using system
PowerShell, before setup-python/setup-uv and default-pwsh run steps. It reports
installed shells/tools, memory and selected paths, verifies installed pwsh and
native Git Bash (not the System32 WSL launcher). Bash receives only the command
token `uname`; PowerShell requires a successful exit and exactly one native
MINGW/MSYS result. This avoids both nested argument quoting and a BOM prefixed
to a stdin script. The composite then
uses the repository-pinned setup-node action to provide Node 24 on CodeBuild only.
The measured image's Node 20 was below the required floor.
After dependency setup, hard probes require Python 3.12, Git, uv, jq and Node
at the supported floor, exact token-user file ownership, owner-only ACL
application, file symlinks, rename and cleanup under workspace and runner temp.
Owner errors include both SIDs. gh is not required because backend tests stub
its calls. Probes touch only disposable files and log no environment dump or
credentials. Hosted setup and test behavior is unchanged.

The reusable Linux boundary has one eight-way shard measurement:
[run 35374412954, job 105696454897](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/actions/runs/35374412954/job/105696454897)
reports 12,998 passed, 42 skipped and 5 xfailed in 473.89 seconds. It does not prove
all eight shards, Windows image capabilities, Black with the new worker cap, or
service cleanup. Retain each newly executed job's log/progress artifact, compare
counts against its hosted population, verify coverage combine/gate, and confirm
build termination and runner deregistration. Linux local tests cannot establish
native Windows or CodeBuild lifecycle facts. Task Scheduler pod boot, interactive
installer, namespace E2E/sandbox, release and GUI jobs remain outside this migration
pending real container proof or infrastructure approval.

Rollback needs no AWS change: set Linux resolver outputs to `ubuntu-latest` and
Windows to `windows-latest`, and return the two direct routes (`changes` and
`await-fast-gate`) to hosted; an individual consumer can instead use its hosted
label. Boot-matrix rollback restores `runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}`. Keep the test
arguments and coverage unchanged. A rejected webhook leaves a job queued before
its timeout starts; diagnose or roll back rather than raising that timeout.

### macOS is not a pull-request gate any more

The macOS pytest lane ran in this table until the queue was measured. On three
consecutive green PR runs (34866269260, 34864945056, 34863753125) the macOS jobs
waited **176, 190 and 213 minutes** for a `macos-15` runner and then ran for 26-33.
Everything non-macOS finished at 78-98 minutes while the runs took 248-268, so ~64%
of a pull request's CI wall clock was macOS queue time — and since `PR Readiness`
is triggered by `workflow_run` on `ci.yml`'s completion, that queue sat on the merge
button. In the same window the lane failed 0 times and was **cancelled 129 times**,
usually still queued when a newer push superseded the run. Linux escapes this
because `changes` routes it to the CodeBuild runners; there is no self-hosted macOS
pool, so the queue is not tunable here.

Where the coverage went:

| Lane | Where | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| `backend-test-macos` (full suite, 3 shards) | `platform-tests.yml`: called by `nightly.yml` at 06:00 UTC, plus `workflow_dispatch` against any branch | Holds the nightly **publish** jobs, never the builds — the artifacts are the evidence a fixer works from. Maintains one tracking issue (`platform-tests-macos` label) carrying the failing node ids and the pull requests merged in the last 24h |
| The same suite, on demand | `macos-on-demand.yml`, `pull_request`, calls `platform-tests.yml` against the PR head; a Linux `decide` job runs it when the diff touches a darwin-sensitive path, **or** the PR carries the `ci:macos` label, **or** the head SHA falls in a 1-in-20 sample (`16#${HEAD_SHA:0:8} % 20`, deterministic per commit) (acts immediately -- the workflow listens for `labeled`) | Advisory. It is a separate workflow ON PURPOSE: a macOS job inside `ci.yml` holds that workflow's completion even with `continue-on-error`, so it would still hold readiness. Readiness evaluates neither this workflow nor its check |
| Real gateway boot on macOS | `ci.yml`'s `e2e-boot-matrix`, push-to-main leg; `nightly.yml`'s `pod-scenarios` | Blocking on main / holds nothing in the nightly |

`test/test_macos_platform_tests_gate.py` pins all of it, including the property that
nothing on the required `pull_request` path may instantiate a macOS runner.
The on-demand Darwin path list includes the shared hooks, pinned filesystem
primitives, outbox handlers, descriptor regression suite and theme-install suite.
Changes to any of them select the native macOS suite on each push without
requiring a label or a sample hit. The lane remains advisory; a Linux simulation
is not evidence of native APFS behavior.

The native contracts in `test/test_darwin_native_provider_reap.py` and their
`session_pid`, `session_lifecycle`, `session_cleanup`, and `session_pool` callers
are explicit on-demand paths. They exercise real Darwin process identities,
zombie-root reaping, reaped-root group recovery, escaped descendants, and three
rounds each of idle expiry, pool-health TTL and claim-time TTL cleanup. Only the
provider protocol and clock are simulated; every process belongs to the test,
and fixture cleanup is independent of the production reaper. These are native
regression tests, not a live-gateway soak or a before/after memory measurement.

Details worth knowing:

- **CodeBuild-hosted runner (pilot).** `cfn-lint` is the first job whose
  `runs-on` is not a GitHub-hosted label but
  `codebuild-kirocrew-gha-linux-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}`:
  an AWS CodeBuild project subscribed to this repository's `workflow_job` webhook
  starts one ephemeral self-hosted runner per queued job, runs that single job,
  and terminates. Why: at peak the repository's `ubuntu-latest` queue holds a
  30-second job for 13 minutes (measured 2026-09-11 on this job: mean queue 155 s,
  max 788 s, 6 of 29 runs over five minutes), and the repository is ~99% of the
  org's Actions consumption, so the wait is a fair-use ceiling no workflow change
  can lift. Reproducible source for the deployed runner infrastructure remains
  follow-up work; this public repository only selects existing projects.
  **Second wave:** `frontend-test` (4 shards), `frontend-coverage-merge`,
  `coverage-combine` and `coverage-gate` are routed the same way. The frontend
  shards add an `instance-size:large` label suffix (8 vCPU / 15 GB, the hosted
  runner's memory class; the default CodeBuild size has 7 GB) because `vitest
  --coverage` is memory-bound; the merge and the two Python coverage jobs use
  the project default. One thing the runner changes for the merge: every
  CodeBuild build has its own workspace root (`/codebuild/output/src<random>/…`),
  and a vitest blob stores paths absolute, so the four shards' blobs arrive with
  four different roots and `--merge-reports --coverage` unions nothing (each
  file reported four times, non-zero exit, no failing test named — the pilot's
  first two runs). `frontend-coverage-merge` therefore rewrites each blob's
  root to its own checkout before merging
  (`.github/scripts/frontend-blob-normalize-paths.mjs`); on hosted runners the
  roots already match and the step is a no-op. The Python side has the same
  seam — the `backend-test` shards (hosted) record coverage under
  `/home/runner/work/…` and `coverage-combine` (CodeBuild) runs under another
  root — closed at the source instead: `[coverage:run] relative_files = true`
  in `setup.cfg`, so shard data files carry repo-relative paths and combine
  wherever the repo is checked out. A third effect of that root: vitest matches
  `coverage.include` against the absolute path with picomatch `contains`, so
  `src/**` is satisfied by the `/src/actions-runner/` segment of every
  CodeBuild checkout and non-`src/` files loaded by tests (integration mocks,
  `scripts/`) gained coverage numbers of their own, which the per-file gate
  failed. `website/vite.config.ts` now excludes every non-`src/` directory of
  `website/` by name, anchored on `website/`, which is a no-op on hosted paths.
  **Backend shards also use large compute**, with the in-job non-root boundary
  described in [Linux and Windows CodeBuild migration](#linux-and-windows-codebuild-migration).
  `test/test_ci_fleet_routing_expression_parity.py` pins each complete resolver
  consumer expression, including its hosted fallback and OS mapping.
  Root semantics and the measured jq/lsof/libpython gaps are handled there;
  namespace enforcement jobs still require their hosted kernel capabilities.
  Peak-hour measurement behind the move (2026-09-11, 38 runs):
  backend shards queued p90 521 s / max 763 s, frontend shards p90 569 s / max
  813 s, with 103 of these jobs running at once. Things to know when touching it:
  - **Forks never see it.** The label is computed once, in the `changes` job
    (outputs `linux_runner` and `linux_runner_large`), and the routed jobs read
    it as `runs-on: ${{ needs.changes.outputs.linux_runner || 'ubuntu-latest' }}`,
    so there is one copy of the decision rather than one per job, and a job
    that runs after `changes` failed (`coverage-gate` fails closed with
    `if: always()`) still gets a runner instead of erroring out before its own
    checks execute: a run in any
    repository other than `kirodotdev/KiroCrew` (a fork's own CI on its `main`),
    or a `pull_request` whose head repository is not this one, gets
    `ubuntu-latest`; every other run still needs the event and actor checks
    in [the migration contract](#linux-and-windows-codebuild-migration) before
    receiving the CodeBuild label. The webhook on the AWS side is
    additionally filtered to runs triggered by accounts that can push to this
    repository (plus dependabot), so a fork PR that rewrites its workflow to force
    the label never starts a build — its job simply never gets a runner. The
    `workflow_job` payload carries no "from a fork" bit, which is why both layers
    exist rather than one.
  - **The image is not `ubuntu-latest`.** It is `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`
    (Ubuntu 22.04). Anything a job assumed pre-installed must come from a
    `setup-*` action; `cfn-lint` already installs its own Python. Moving another
    job here means checking that first.
  - **Rollback is one line:** in the `changes` job's `Pick the Linux runner
    label` step, set both outputs to `ubuntu-latest` (or, for one job, replace
    its `runs-on` reference with `ubuntu-latest`). A CodeBuild project that
    receives webhooks for jobs it does not match starts nothing.
  - **A queued job is not bounded by `timeout-minutes`.** That budget starts when a
    runner picks the job up. A job whose log shows the `codebuild-…` label and no
    runner means the webhook did not start a build — the project name in the label
    does not match, or the triggering account is not on the allowlist (a new
    maintainer's first push) — and it will sit *queued* until GitHub's own
    ~24-hour pending limit, blocking that PR's `PR Readiness` the whole time with
    no in-repo signal. The response is the rollback above, not waiting for the
    timeout; the allowlist and the project name are fixed on the infrastructure
    side, not in this file.
  - **A runner that starts and then loses its job leaves the job queued forever,
    and a watchdog heals it.** The webhook can start a build and the job can
    still never run. Every CodeBuild build registers a fresh just-in-time
    runner, and that runner has to open a broker session with GitHub before it
    can take the job. On 2026-09-12 the broker answered the runner's first
    `CreateSession` with a 500 having already half-created the session, so every
    retry was refused with "a session for this runner already exists";
    `actions/runner` gives up on that conflict after a hard-coded four minutes,
    GitHub's cleanup of the ghost session takes longer than that, and the runner
    exits 0 — CodeBuild recorded the build as SUCCEEDED. The job it was started
    for stayed *queued* (its label names one run attempt, so no other runner can
    ever match it; see the `timeout-minutes` point above), the run stayed
    *in_progress*, and because the `CI` concurrency group does not cancel
    in-progress runs on `main`, every later `main` push was held *pending* behind
    it and then evicted by the next push: one orphaned frontend shard held
    `main`'s group for ten hours (19:33 to 05:31 UTC) and cost eleven `main`
    verdicts before a human cancelled the run. The runner-side defect is
    upstream and open
    ([actions/runner#3441](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/3441);
    same family as
    [#3624](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/3624) and
    [#2809](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/2809)), so the repository
    carries a watchdog rather than waiting for it:
    `.github/workflows/ci-runner-watchdog.yml` runs `scripts/ci/runner_watchdog.py`
    every ten minutes on `ubuntu-latest` (never on CodeBuild — a watchdog for a
    path cannot depend on that path). It lists the queued and in-progress runs
    REPO-WIDE — one paginated `GET /repos/{repo}/actions/runs?status=…` per
    status returns runs of every workflow at once — and keeps only those whose
    `path` names a workflow that routes jobs to the CodeBuild fleet — `ci.yml`,
    `fast-gate.yml`, `main-ratchet-audit.yml`, `build.yml` and eleven others,
    the set pinned in the script as `WATCHED_WORKFLOWS` and tested against the
    workflows whose `runs-on` actually carries the fleet label (the watchdog's
    own workflow is excluded, since that label appears only in its comment). One
    listing per status covers the whole watched set as a client-side filter and
    reaches more than a per-workflow loop would. Live statuses read at most eight
    pages each, and each live classification sweep reads jobs for at most 50
    runs: 40 to the oldest, which are the only actionable ones, and 10 reserved
    for the newest, whose prompt CodeBuild starts are the dispatch evidence a
    saturation hold is judged by. Spending the whole bound oldest first would
    leave a backlogged sweep unable to tell a dead fleet from a busy one, so it
    would heal nothing exactly when the watchdog is needed. The log names the
    bound when other runs wait for the
    next tick. Cancelled recovery reads at most sixteen pages because GitHub
    orders that index by creation time while recovery selects by cancellation
    time. The three live indexes plus the cancelled index cost at most 40 calls
    per tick. It
    calls a run *orphaned* when one of its jobs is still `queued`,
    carries a `codebuild-` label, and has waited more than 15 minutes
    (queue-to-start on CodeBuild is measured in seconds here, so that margin is
    generous). It then cancels the run, waits for the cancellation to land, and
    re-runs it: the re-run is a new attempt, so `changes` recomputes the label
    with the new attempt suffix and GitHub emits fresh `workflow_job.queued`
    webhooks that start fresh runners. The re-run cap of five per tick is one
    global budget across every watched workflow, not five per workflow. The
    watchdog re-runs *all* jobs rather
    than only the failed ones, because `gh run rerun --failed` reuses the first
    attempt's `changes` outputs and therefore re-queues the routed jobs under a
    label whose attempt suffix is stale, and CodeBuild's documentation does not
    say whether it honours that. A workflow clears TWO heal-safety gates. The
    declared gate is `HEAL_SAFE_WORKFLOWS`, a written judgement that a full
    re-run is safe, and it is the LOAD-BEARING one: a workflow joining the
    watched set is exempt until a person puts it there. The derived gate is
    BEST-EFFORT. It requires a run-level concurrency group
    keyed on `github.ref`, `github.ref_name`, `github.head_ref`, or
    `github.event.pull_request.number`, which is a structural fact it reads
    reliably, and it rejects the publish and deploy spellings it knows: package
    or release
    publishing, Pages deployment, Docker pushes, S3 or CodeArtifact publishing,
    signing or notarization, any job-level `environment:`, and `pages: write`,
    `packages: write`, or `deployments: write`. `id-token: write` alone is
    ordinary OIDC authentication. A publish step in a spelling the patterns miss
    (`cargo publish`, `uv publish`, a new marketplace action) is caught by
    neither gate, which is why the declaration is the judgement and the
    derivation is a backstop rather than the reverse. Pinning each declared
    workflow's content instead would expire the declaration on every edit to
    `ci.yml` or `fast-gate.yml`, the two most-edited files in the repo, so the
    cost lands on every unrelated change. `HEAL_SAFE_WORKFLOWS` in
    `scripts/ci/runner_watchdog.py` is the membership, and a partition test
    pins it against `WATCHED_WORKFLOWS`, so read the set rather than a count
    here: prose restating a pinned set goes stale in silence. The reasons a
    workflow lands outside it are publishing, a per-commit or per-run
    concurrency key, no run-level group at all, and a constant group. Exempt
    runs stay listed, classified, logged, and named in the
    step summary with a `human-required-heal-exempt-workflow` outcome. The
    watchdog never cancels or fully re-runs them. Immediately before a live
    orphan is cancelled, the watchdog reads the workflow file from that run's
    `head_sha` through the repository contents API and re-derives heal-safety.
    Cancelled-orphan recovery performs the same run-revision check before its
    re-run. A revision read and judged unsafe is human-required and healthy; a
    revision nobody could read, or a run with no SHA, is UNKNOWN rather than
    unsafe and reports `heal-safety-unreadable-at-run-revision`, a FAILED
    outcome, so a cancelled run cannot age out of its window behind a green
    tick. Neither answer cancels anything. A queued `codebuild-` job is
    also what CodeBuild account-concurrency saturation looks like, so the
    watchdog reads what the *other* routed jobs are doing, counting only starts
    after the orphaned job queued (a fleet that was fine before the orphan
    queued says nothing about the fleet it is waiting on) — if a CodeBuild job
    that did get a runner started in that window after waiting five
    minutes or more, CodeBuild is queueing, and the tick reports the runs as
    `skipped-saturated` and heals nothing; if *nothing* has started on
    CodeBuild in that window (live runs, then the newest completed runs), the
    evidence is inconclusive — a fleet outage looks exactly like an orphan from
    the queued side — and the tick reports `skipped-no-dispatch-evidence`,
    heals nothing, and points at the rollback above. Guard rails: runs younger than
    15 minutes are never actionable (their jobs are still read, since a slow
    start inside one is saturation evidence); the verdict is re-derived from a fresh read
    immediately before the cancel and the cancel is sent only if the same
    attempt is still orphaned (a human who re-ran it by hand has moved it to a
    new attempt, which is left alone); fork runs are reported, never touched; a
    run at attempt 3 or later is reported, never touched, so a run that keeps
    orphaning is escalated rather than looped; at most five runs are healed per
    tick; a refused cancel or re-run (403 when a human got there first) is
    logged and left for the next tick. Once a cancel is accepted the watchdog
    owns the run until it is re-run: it polls to `completed`, escalates to
    `force-cancel` after 90 s, and re-runs each run as it completes inside one
    shared five-minute budget. The whole tick runs inside the script's own
    nine-minute budget, and a re-run is begun only while enough of it remains
    to verify the re-run at its longest (a newer run landing in the window and
    being restored, in turn), so the job's `timeout-minutes` — set above the
    budget — never cuts a restoration off half-way; a re-run that cannot start
    in time is named in an error and left for the recovery pass. The
    saturation/outage evidence is re-read once before any run is re-read for
    its cancel and judged against the current wall clock, so a run's own
    re-read sits immediately before its cancel, and a fleet that saturated
    since the top of the tick holds the run (and one that cannot be re-read
    fails closed); a cancel itself is posted only while enough of the budget
    remains to verify its re-run. The API has no conditional cancel or
    re-run, so each mutation is verified after the fact: once a cancel lands, the run's
    conclusion and attempt are read back (a run that finished on its own keeps
    its verdict; one somebody re-ran in the gap is re-run again), and every
    re-run is bracketed by unconditional newest-of-branch checks — before it,
    and again after a short settle. Heal-safety determines whether the watchdog
    may reach that guard; the guard itself treats every heal-safe run alike.
    This keeps a newer run from being left cancelled by the re-run's entry into
    a supersedable concurrency group: the re-run is
    cancelled, that cancellation is waited out (force-cancelled if slow; if it
    still has not completed the tick fails rather than judge), and the newer run is read
    until it reaches a terminal state or the settle window closes (a cancelled
    successor is re-run through the same bracket, so a run landing in *its*
    window is restored in turn, two levels deep at most, unless a yet-newer run
    has taken the branch over; one still running when the window closes is
    never called settled, since a group cancel can land late, and is a named
    failure instead). Every read on that path
    is guarded (and a cancel or re-run whose response was lost is never
    re-posted — it is reconciled from the run's own state, since a repeat on a
    landed mutation is a conflict that would read as a refusal), and every wait is a wall-clock window capped by the tick's
    deadline (API latency counts, not just the sleeps): an API failure keeps the run owned (a status poll that fails is
    retried until the shared deadline names the run; a successor that cannot be
    read for the whole window is a failed outcome that names it), and a read
    that fails before any mutation leaves the run untouched — no API error can
    escape the heal with a cancelled run unnamed. The lookup behind those
    checks matches branch *names*, which forks share, so it is paged until a
    run from the same head repository appears and fails closed — red tick, run
    named — if the listing never reaches ours; a successor that does not settle
    inside the window, a successor that cannot be re-run, and a re-run refusal
    that nobody else's re-run explains all red the tick the same way, so a lost
    verdict is never a green watchdog; a run that outlives the budget is named in an
    error, the job exits 1, and the next tick's recovery pass re-runs it —
    that pass reads recently cancelled `CI` runs, pull requests included,
    recognises the orphan fingerprint on their cancelled jobs (`codebuild-`
    label, no runner name, queued past the threshold when cancelled — a shape a
    healthy run a human stopped never shows, so a deliberate cancel is not
    resurrected), applies the same unconditional newest-of-branch guard, and
    re-runs only those still newest.
    The saturation/outage hold does not apply to it: that hold protects
    finished work, and a cancelled orphan has none left — re-running it into an
    outage leaves it queued until the fleet returns, whereas holding it would
    let the recovery window expire and abandon it silently. It runs before the
    live heals and takes the per-tick cap first, so a sustained backlog of live
    orphans cannot starve it until the window expires. It walks the window
    **oldest first** and classifies at most `RECOVERY_CLASSIFY_READS` (50) runs
    per tick, because every `main` push cancels the run it supersedes and one
    90-minute window holds hundreds of cancelled runs (300 measured), each
    costing a job read: the bound spends those reads on the runs closest to
    ageing out, and a newer arrival waits for the next tick instead of
    displacing an older orphan. **A GitHub rate limit is
    survivable, not a lost tick.** A 403 or 429 whose body names a rate limit is
    honoured against its `Retry-After` / `X-RateLimit-Reset` with one cheap,
    in-budget wait-and-retry; when the reset is too far off, the tick stops
    gathering, acts on the runs it already classified, and ends with an
    `aborted-rate-limited` outcome the summary names. That outcome is a FAILURE
    and the tick exits nonzero, whatever it managed to classify first: the same
    abort skips the cancelled-orphan recovery pass, and recovery is the only
    thing between a cancelled run and the end of its 90-minute window, so
    "the next tick re-lists" is no answer for a run in the final tick-interval of
    that window while the limit persists. What the abort still buys is the work
    already done: one exhausted listing page leaves the runs already classified
    acted on rather than lost. Every other status (401, 404, 5xx) and every
    malformed payload still raises. **The schedule ships disarmed**: `WATCHDOG_ARMED` at the top of the
    workflow is `"false"`, so every scheduled tick is a dry run — it classifies
    and writes its step summary but touches nothing — until a maintainer, having
    read a few summaries against real API shapes and seen no healthy run called
    `orphaned`, flips it to `"true"` in a one-line commit. A manual dispatch is
    governed by its own `dry_run` input regardless, so a stuck run can be healed
    by hand before arming. A `CI` run in *pending* with no jobs is
    **not** something the watchdog touches — that run is waiting on its
    concurrency group, not on a runner, and healing the run that holds the group
    is what releases it; the step summary names it so the reader knows why it
    waits. **Manual fallback** when the watchdog itself is held queued by
    Actions saturation, or for a run it declined: `gh run cancel <run-id>`, wait
    for the run to report `completed`, then `gh run rerun <run-id>`
    (`gh run rerun <run-id> --failed` keeps the successful jobs but carries the
    stale-label caveat). `workflow_dispatch` with `dry_run: true` (the default
    for a manual dispatch) detects and reports without acting.
  - **Trust model.** A self-hosted runner exposes its host identity to the job it
    runs; that is inherent, not something this PR adds. What bounds it: only runs
    triggered by accounts that can push here reach the runner (forks never do);
    the runner role can write one log group and mint a GitHub token from one
    connection, nothing else, in an account holding nothing else; and an alert fires on
    any token minted through that connection by anything other than CodeBuild's own
    runner registration. The residual — a job step minting a GitHub App token whose
    repository permissions may exceed a writer's — is detected, not prevented.
    Two recommended controls are **not yet in place**: an organization-level
    ruleset on `main` whose bypass excludes GitHub Apps (drafted; needs an org
    owner), and a check that the App installation is scoped to this repository
    alone (needs repository-settings access).
  - **Pilot exit condition.** The pilot ends on whichever comes first: **50
    non-fork `CI` runs** with the second wave in place or **2026-10-10**. The
    second wave went in one day after the first, on the first wave's early data
    (every `cfn-lint` build started 18–21 s after the job was queued) plus the
    second wave's own first run (all ten jobs it routed, same 18–21 s); that is a
    small sample, which is why the criterion below now covers the whole routed
    set rather than gating a further expansion. Keep the routing only if the
    median queue-to-start on CodeBuild stays under 60 s and no routed job waits
    longer than the hosted baseline's mean (155 s) for a runner; otherwise roll
    it back. Migrating the feasible jobs together in one PR does not waive this
    queue-retention criterion. Record Linux and Windows startup evidence separately;
    a running job or a successful test result does not establish acceptable queue
    latency. Namespace-dependent jobs (`backend-test-sandbox`,
    `e2e-private-namespace`), the Task Scheduler pod boot canary, the IPv6 and
    strict kernel-lock legs, Linux packaging and macOS retain hosted runners.
    Record the measured outcome so this entry does not become a permanent one-off.

- **The macOS peer-identity canary is asserted by name.** `pytest -q` does not name
  passing tests and a skip exits 0, so a canary that quietly stopped running (a
  changed `skipif`, a collection change) would leave the job green while the gate
  it proves went unverified. The step runs that one node id with `-v` and greps for
  `1 passed`.
- **`backend-test-sandbox` fails loudly rather than skipping.** It clears
  `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns`, then runs `unshare --mount
  --map-root-user true` as a probe. If the runner image ever stops allowing the
  namespace, the job fails instead of letting the suite silently skip and the gate
  go green having asserted nothing. This is what gives the `hooks.py`
  sensitive-path keystone real CI coverage.
- **`backend-test-crew-container` cannot go green by skipping.** Installing the
  image's runtime dependencies in a dedicated lane fixes one instance of the
  problem; the mechanism that caused it, a conftest that answers a missing
  dependency with `collect_ignore_glob`, so 226 tests read as present while
  executing zero times, survives any dependency rename or extras split. So the lane
  that installs them also sets `CREW_CONTAINER_TESTS_REQUIRED=1`, and under that
  variable the suite refuses to skip: a missing dependency or a non-POSIX host is a
  collection error, every `test_*.py` that defines a test function must contribute at
  least one collected item, and the total must clear a floor read off a real
  collection. The variable can only ever turn a skip into a failure, never the
  reverse, so setting it can hide nothing. This is the same shape as
  `backend-test-sandbox`'s `unshare` probe, moved inside the instrument.
- **`coverage-gate` is fail-closed, and the split made that load-bearing.** It runs
  `if: always()` and its first step converts any non-success upstream result into an
  explicit failure, because GitHub treats a **skipped** required check as satisfied.
  That was already the right shape when the only way to skip a test job was a path
  filter or a failed dependency. It is now the mechanism that keeps the whole
  `await-fast-gate` design honest: a red gate deliberately SKIPS `backend-test` and
  `frontend-test`, and without this step a required Coverage Gate would skip with
  them and be reported as satisfied — so the barrier that exists to save runner time
  would also have quietly removed the coverage floor. The `if: always()` is what
  makes it emit a real verdict, and the first step is what makes that verdict red.
  `frontend-coverage-merge` carries the other half of the same problem and solves it
  the opposite way: its `!cancelled()` needed an explicit
  `needs.frontend-test.result != 'skipped'` clause, because a skipped shard set has
  nothing to stitch and the merge would otherwise go red for missing an artifact
  instead of for the gate the developer actually has to fix. A FAILED shard set still
  has something to stitch, which is why the clause names `skipped` and not both. It
  also compares the raw line-rate and rounds only for display, so 89.95% cannot pass
  a 90% floor.
- **`coverage-gate` enforces two different shapes.** The project floors
  (`BACKEND_MIN`, `FRONTEND_MIN`) compare one lane-wide average; the per-file floor
  (`PER_FILE_MIN`, `scripts/check_per_file_coverage.py`) requires *every measured
  file* to clear it. Both are needed because an average is satisfiable without
  touching the files that carry the risk — a well-covered large file pays for a
  bare small one. The per-file gate exempts only the files listed in
  `.github/coverage-baselines/{backend,frontend}.txt`, and that list may only
  shrink: an unlisted file below the floor fails, a listed file that slides further
  fails, and a listed file that *clears* the floor by the same noise band fails
  until it is removed. Refresh with `--update-baseline`, which **prunes only** —
  it cannot add a path or rewrite a recorded rate, so neither a new offender nor a
  regression can be cleared by refreshing instead of by adding tests; seeding a
  new lane is a separate `--seed-baseline`. The floor's rationale and measured
  cost live in the script's docstring, not here, so they cannot go stale in two
  places. Per-file enforcement is skipped for a lane whose suite ran as a
  coverage-free subset, because subset rates are not comparable to a baseline
  recorded on the full suite.
- **`eslint src/ --max-warnings 0` is a hard ceiling, not a stored baseline.**
  The tree carries no warnings, so any warning a change introduces fails this
  job. Never lift the ceiling to admit one: a ceiling above the measured count is
  a budget new warnings land inside without anyone seeing them, and a warning
  admitted that way is indistinguishable from the rest. Fix it, or suppress that
  one line with `// eslint-disable-next-line <rule> -- <why the code is correct>`,
  which is reviewable in the diff where a lifted ceiling is not.
  `test_eslint_warning_ceiling.py` pins the zero and pins that `ci.yml` declares
  exactly one ceiling, so it cannot be lifted quietly — and because the value is
  fixed rather than measured, naming it here cannot go stale.
- **The i18n gates split into three tiers,** and only two can fail: diff-scoped
  zero-tolerance checks (a user-visible literal on a line this branch wrote, a
  file holding more than it did at the base, new English key shape, changed catalog
  values) and whole-repo hard zeros (a `t()` naming a key that does not exist,
  plural concatenation, a stale pseudolocale). Everything else is report-only,
  because a stored whole-repo total is written by whichever branch measured it last,
  so another branch can push it past its number without touching your files and the
  failure then names no diff anyone can fix. Full rules:
  [i18n-gates.md](i18n-gates.md).
- **Every gate that needs a base ref fails rather than skipping when it cannot
  resolve one.** `actions/checkout` fetches depth 1, so
  `.github/scripts/resolve-i18n-base.sh` fetches the one commit and exits non-zero
  if it cannot; a gate that cannot run must fail, not pass.
- **`I18N_BASE_REF` is `pull_request.base.sha`, not `origin/main`.** The base tip is
  a moving target measured at step time while the checked-out tree is a snapshot
  from job start, so anything landing on `main` in between would appear only on the
  base side and be charged to every PR in that window.
- **The e2e gateway boots with `KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_PERSIST=1`**, so an
  un-offloaded session-JSONL mutator that enters the lock on the event loop raises
  and fails the gate at PR time. `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1` turns an
  environment-resolution miss into a hard failure, since a skipped suite would
  otherwise count as a pass having run zero browser specs. Details:
  [e2e-gate.md](e2e-gate.md).

## `build.yml`: the artifacts still build

PR-time proof only, no publishing.

- **`build-wheel`** builds the frontend, stages it into the package, builds the
  wheel, then `pip install dist/*.whl` and `kirocrew --version` as a smoke test.
  Bare `--version` is a pre-dispatch fast-path (see
  `docs/system-specs/modules/cli.md`), so it proves the console script exists
  and exits 0 — not that `kiro_crew.cli`'s import chain resolves. An
  `import kiro_crew.cli` probe is what carries that meaning; the wheel lane
  does not run one, so an undeclared runtime dependency reaches gateway boot
  before any pip-install lane fails.
- **`build-desktop`** builds the Electron app unsigned on macos-15 and
  ubuntu-22.04 via `make desktop`, and uploads the artifacts.

**Neither desktop lane ever RUNS the bundled backend.** `build-desktop` here and
`build-desktop.yml` in the release lane both build the real `kirocrew-backend`
tree via `packaging/build-desktop.sh` — which provisions a
python-build-standalone interpreter and pip-installs the project into it — and
then only upload the artifact. The wheel lane at least runs `kirocrew --version`,
which since the `--version` fast-path lands before dispatch proves startup only.
So a packaging change that breaks the packaged app (a layout change, a launcher
rename, a dependency that fails to install into the bundled interpreter) passes
every gate: the tests that cover packaged-app behavior monkeypatch `sys.frozen`
and `sys.executable`, so they stay green against a simulated environment. The
cheap fix is to run the already-built launcher once in `build-desktop`, the
packaged analogue of the wheel lane's `--version`.

## `code-review.yml`: the deterministic pre-gate

No model, no secrets, so it is safe on forks and always runs. It is the grep-half
of the AUTOSDE rules; the semantic half is delegated to the line reviewers.

- **`autosde-rules`** blocks unambiguous frontend violations on added lines: an
  inline `<svg viewBox>` outside brand-mark components (`KiroGhost.tsx`, `*Logo.tsx`,
  `*Ghost.tsx`), a `<div>`/`<span>` with `onClick` and no `role`, `.innerHTML =`,
  Mermaid `securityLevel: 'loose'`, and an oversized `max-w-[>=900px]` page wrapper.
  It also blocks three backend keystones: a sensitive credential or keystone path
  read that does not go through `is_sensitive_path()`, `denied_commands.json`
  dropping off `security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` or the governance boot-integrity
  tuple, and a bare `bool()` on an operator-editable boolean opt-out field
  (`bool("false")` is truthy, which would silently disable every protection).
  Advisory warnings, which never fail: unsanitized `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`,
  hardcoded Tailwind colors, new CSS `@keyframes`, sub-10px text.
- **`inclusive-language`** runs a SHA-pinned `woke` (`WOKE_VERSION`, fetched through `get-woke`) over added lines only, failing on `(error)` severity findings; grepping the terms in `.woke.yml` is NOT equivalent to the gate, and an intentional term is exempted with `# wokeignore:rule=<term>` **on the offending line itself** — `woke` matches per line, so a marker on its own line exempts nothing and leaves the gate red (see the markers beside `master_fd` in `dashboard/handlers/terminal.py`). <!-- wokeignore:rule=master --> Legacy violations are burned down separately; this stops
  new ones.
- **`sast`** runs Semgrep in a pinned container: first `semgrep --test` over the
  custom rules in `semgrep/` against the annotated fixtures in `semgrep-tests/`
  (both directions — a `ruleid:` line must match, an `ok:` line must not — so a
  rule regression goes red here, not on a later unrelated PR; the rules dir is
  non-hidden because semgrep 1.78's test mode cannot discover tests under a
  hidden directory), then the scan itself, diff-only against the base,
  community packs plus `semgrep/`, with `--error`. The fixtures are listed in
  `.semgrepignore` so the deliberately vulnerable fixture code is never read by
  the scan. Blocking.
- The production dependency audit (`dependency-vulnerability.yml`, which runs
  `scripts/check_npm_audit.py` over every lockfile-backed Node project and fails
  closed on **high or critical production** vulnerabilities) is **not** a PR
  job. It reaches the npm registry, whose slow hours made it the one red X on
  otherwise-green PRs and then failed nightlies for hours at a stretch. It runs
  where a vulnerable dependency would actually ship: before every release build,
  and — since main carries no dependency gate of its own — before every nightly
  **publish**. On the nightly it gates the publish jobs only, never the builds,
  so a slow registry delays publication of an already-built nightly instead of
  failing the build. Time-boxed exceptions live in
  `.vulnerability-exceptions.json`, and a registry stall or connection fault is
  retried inside one shared time budget before it fails (see the
  transient-failure contract in the security spec).
- **`pr-hygiene`** enforces a Conventional-Commits PR title (it becomes the
  squash-merge message) and at most two commits (`git rev-list --count <= 2`).
  One commit stays the norm; the second is there so a mechanical follow-up (a
  regenerated artifact, a formatting sweep) can stay separable from the change
  it accompanies. Both blocking.

Separately, **`dependency-review.yml`** fails a PR that adds or changes a
dependency whose license is off the curated allowlist in
`.github/dependency-review-config.yml`. A maintainer can bypass it for the commit
they reviewed with the `license-override` label, honored **only** on the `labeled`
event, so a later push arrives as `synchronize` and re-runs the gate; a new,
unvetted dependency cannot ride in on a stale override.

**`docker-smoke.yml`** is paths-filtered to the container surface (`docker/**` plus
the three source files the container contract spans: the bind override in
`dashboard/origin.py`, the probe Host-barrier exemption in `dashboard/server.py`,
and the liveness payload in `dashboard/handlers/core.py`). It builds the image from
a locally-built wheel and proves, across a real container boundary, that
`KIROCREW_BIND=0.0.0.0` makes the gateway reachable from the host, that token auth
still guards the API on that non-loopback path, that `/api/health` works (the image
HEALTHCHECK depends on it), that kiro-cli runs inside the image, and that channel
credentials passed as container env are moved into the data home's `.env` and
scrubbed from every long-lived process environ.

**`crew-image-build.yml`** runs `docker build` for the AWS Control crew images, which
nothing did before: `backend-test-crew-container` imports the image's Python modules and
runs them on the HOST, so the recipes that merged in #9223 each named a producer script
that was not in the tree and every check stayed green — the image could not be built from
a clean checkout, and no gate said so.

It does not name the two recipes. `scripts/crew_image_build_plan.py` asks the tree which
`Dockerfile*` exist under the crew runtime directory and derives each one's role and
producer from the recipe's own text — a pre-`FROM` `ARG` interpolated by the `FROM` is a
digest-pinned layer, a concrete `FROM` is a base, and the producer is the `scripts/*.sh`
the recipe cites — then refuses anything it cannot account for, including a `FROM` that
interpolates an out-of-scope `ARG` and would silently expand to an empty string. So a
third recipe added later is built or reds the lane, rather than being as uncovered as
these two were. `test_crew_image_build_plan.py` holds the cheap half of that reasoning on
every pull request with no Docker at all.

The crew layer's base is referenced by digest, and only a push produces a repository
digest, so the lane runs a throwaway `registry:2` on `127.0.0.1`: real digest, no
credentials, and therefore runnable on a fork PR with no secrets. It is paths-filtered to
the crew runtime subtree, the producers and the wheel-packaging manifests, and carries a
weekly `schedule` because that path set cannot be complete — the build reaches Debian,
PyPI and the pinned kiro-cli tarball. Measured cold: ~100 seconds of build for a 1.5 GB
image. Like `docker-smoke.yml` it is absent from `pr-readiness.yml`'s lane list: that file
resolves lanes by workflow file and a lane reading "(not started)" freezes the verdict at
pending, which a paths-filtered lane would do on most PRs.

## The AI review ladder

Five reviewers, each with a distinct question and a distinct trust posture. The
design axis is **what each is allowed to read** (its prompt-injection surface) and
**whether it can block**.

| Reviewer | Check name | Harness | Reads | Question | Blocks? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Opus 4.8 | `Opus 4.8 Review` | Agentic, `--max-turns 120` per stage, **two real invocations** (discovery -> validation) | **Code only**: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Bash(gh pr diff:*)` | Line-level correctness, security, AUTOSDE | Yes, fail-closed |
| GPT 5.6 | `GPT 5.6 Review` | Non-agentic, **two** invocations (discovery, then authoritative falsification), `reasoning_effort: medium` | Code plus PR title and body as nonce-wrapped **UNTRUSTED** context | Line-level second perspective, plus description-versus-diff consistency (advisory) | Yes, fail-closed |
| Design Review | `Design Review` | Agentic Fable 5, with an Opus fallback model | Code plus `gh pr view` (it must judge intent) | Should we build this, and is it the right *shape*? | Advisory; red only on a genuine `BLOCK` |
| UX Review | `UX Review` | Agentic Fable 5, with the same fallback; **two real invocations** on same-repo PRs (blind read -> reconcile) | Pass 1: the PR's screenshots **only** -- the attachments its body links, downloaded, plus any committed image; pass 2: code, PR text, and pass 1's report | Can a first-time user who has read nothing tell what each new element is and does, and do state changes stay one continuous element? | Advisory; red only on a genuine `BLOCK` |
| First Principles | `First Principles Review` | Agentic Fable 5, same fallback, `--max-turns 120` (inventorying and counting is grep-heavy) | Code, the whole repository, and `gh pr view` | What is the author trying to do, and does each thing this ships *deserve to exist*, already exist, or only patch a symptom? | Advisory; red only on a genuine `BLOCK` |

### Why a first-principles lane is not a second Design Review

Design Review takes the PR's **stated problem as its frame** and judges the shape of
the solution. Two blind spots survive that. The first is **plurality**: a change
with one stated purpose routinely ships several observable differences — a control
that moved, a relabelled button, a flipped default, a new knob, a retry — and only
the one named in the description gets examined. The second is **depth**: a fix aimed
at the symptom the author happened to trip over passes every lane, because each line
is correct, the shape fits and the surface renders.

So this lane is defined by a method rather than a topic. It states the author's
**intent** in one sentence and whether the change is a fix or an addition, then
**inventories** it into the **observable differences** it ships — written the way a
person would notice them, not the way the code expresses them — and runs every
remaining question **per item**:

A new capability is only one of the kinds that count. A **move, reorder or regroup**
is its own item, and it is the kind that goes unexamined most often precisely because
nothing became newly possible, so nothing reads as "added". The same applies to a
rename, a changed default, an added or removed confirmation, a change in what is
visible by default, and a change in when something happens. If the change is a *fix*,
every item that is not the fix is called out as **riding along**.

A move also carries a **higher** bar than an addition, not a lower one: the capability
already existed, so the only harm available is that people could not find it, and the
review must name who was failing and how that is known. "It groups better" is analogy,
and it does not outweigh the relearning cost every existing user pays.

- **Does it deserve to exist?** The zero option (what observably breaks if this item
  ships nothing), the delete option (could the same harm be removed by deleting code
  or a concept instead of adding one), and provenance — is the requirement *derived*
  from a constraint you can point at, or *inherited* from convention, symmetry, "for
  flexibility"? Reasoning by analogy is named and rejected explicitly, because
  analogy is how an unnecessary feature enters a codebase looking reasonable.
- **Does it already exist?** A grep for the mechanism that already does this job. A
  second spelling of one capability is a finding even when no code is duplicated,
  because both spellings must then be maintained and will diverge.
- **Does it fix the cause?** Each item is placed on a named chain — **symptom**
  (patched where it was observed), **mechanism** (the code that produced it), or
  **cause** (the decision or invariant gap that let it misbehave). Symptom-level
  with a reachable in-scope cause is a finding. Generality is then decided by
  *counting* unfixed sibling instances of the same cause, so "this is a point patch"
  has to come with paths.

Three constraints keep it honest:

- **One contract, read from the base ref.** The lenses live in
  `.github/review-prompts/first-principles.md`, and both lanes `git show` it from the
  PR's **base** commit — the same mechanism the Opus lanes use for their two prompts.
  That removes the second copy entirely, and it means a pull request cannot edit the
  reviewer that judges it. A contract *absent* from the base is not an error — it is
  what happens on the pull request that introduces or moves the contract, so the lane
  reports a non-blocking "no contract on the base commit" and produces no verdict. It
  never falls back to the head's copy, because a rename would then let a change hand
  the reviewer its own rubric.
- **Count before you claim.** Every duplication, consumer-count and unfixed-sibling
  finding must state the count and the pattern grepped; an uncounted claim is a
  fabrication and must be dropped. This is what stops the lane drifting into taste.
- **Every suggestion is a subtraction.** It may propose only deletions, shrinks,
  deferrals, or "use the thing that already exists" — it may not even ask for a doc
  or an RFC. A reviewer allowed to propose additions becomes a source of the exact
  surface it exists to remove.
- **The inventory is printed, even on a PASS.** A `PASS` here is a claim about *every*
  item, so the item list is the evidence a human needs to check that claim. This is
  a deliberate divergence from the sibling lanes, whose clean verdict collapses to
  one line.

It runs whenever a diff touches product or CI surface — **including a plain bug
fix**, which is where the root-cause lens earns the most. Only a change that ships
no capability at all (docs, tests, screenshots, generated files) skips, so the
2x-rate-card Fable 5 spend goes to diffs that can actually produce a finding.

A `BLOCK` here fails the lane's own check and `pr-readiness.yml` scores that failure as
a readiness blocker, exactly as it does for Design Review and UX Review. Every other
outcome -- `PASS`, `CONCERNS`, an errored or verdict-less run -- exits 0.

Two of its `BLOCK` triggers are read off the evidence rather than judged, so the
"prefer `CONCERNS`" tie-breaker does not reach them:

- **Product shape needs a recorded decision (lens 9).** An item that changes a
  default, changes what a first-class loop, monitor, agent, skill or command does by
  default, or removes or replaces an existing user-facing capability, must trace to a
  decision the repository already recorded: an RFC under `docs/request-for-change/`
  that the **base** commit carries with one of exactly four statuses -- `accepted`,
  `in-progress`, `partial`, `implemented`, the directory README's vocabulary for
  "design agreed"; `draft`, `superseded` and any undefined value are not a decision,
  so the set is closed and nothing fails open -- and a `partial` RFC main deliberately
  diverged from does not cover the diverged shape; or a maintainer's
  `/ai-review override first-principles <head>`
  on that head. The override is consumed by the same-repo lane only: the fork lane
  re-rolls instead, which cannot clear a trigger read off the base RFC list, so on a
  fork PR the remedies are merging the RFC first or a maintainer pushing the branch to
  this repository. The workflow writes the RFC status list from the base sha in the same
  step that extracts the contract, so a PR cannot record its own decision by flipping
  `status:` or shipping the RFC beside the change -- both read as `draft`. That base sha
  is the one the triggering event recorded, and a bare re-run reuses it: once the RFC has
  merged, the author pushes a commit (or rebases) to have the lane read a base that
  carries it -- a re-run alone cannot clear (c). Missing
  both: `BLOCK`, punchline `product-shape change without accepted RFC`. This is not
  the lane asking for a document (which it may not do); it reports that a required
  record is absent and names the two ways it gets made. This is also the First
  Principles lane's *cannot evaluate*: the recorded decision is the one piece of
  evidence this lane requires and cannot produce itself (consumer counts it greps for
  under lens 5; a decision it may not make), so its absence on a product-shape item is
  the verdict the lane cannot reach, and it is never `CONCERNS`. A shape an accepted
  RFC already licenses is not relitigated by asking for its grounds. An ordinary fix
  with thin provenance stays where it was: an `inherited` item, `CONCERNS`.

A third trigger is read off the diff too: **a deleted pin is a prior decision, and
silence about it is the same case as mislabelling it.** When the diff deletes or
rewrites a test, an assertion or a comment that pinned the *opposite* behaviour and
stated why, and the PR shows no evidence the pin was wrong -- no git history, no pin
message, no linked issue -- its framing is contradicted by the diff whether the
description calls the pin "a gap" or never mentions it at all. Symmetry or
consistency with a sibling is not that evidence. Before this clause, only the
mislabelled form reached `BLOCK`; a pin deleted without a word slipped to the
advisory tier as `undeclared` (#10119 deleted a comment reading "This deliberately
supersedes the earlier ... pill spec" plus its pin tests, said nothing, and drew
`CONCERNS`).

**Each finding is stated once.** The lane's output is the verdict header, one bold
punchline that opens with the problem, a `### Not justified as shipped` list, the
collapsed inventory, and -- on `BLOCK` only -- `### Blockers`. Every item that is not
`justified` gets exactly one entry in that list, carrying a `Subtraction:` line where
one exists and its own `Clears when:` line last (the prepare-pr extractor reads from
`Clears when:` to the end of the item as the clearance); there is no `### Watch` and
no `### Subtractions`. Those two sections used to restate the same items a second and
third time (on #10119: three items, three sections, ~600 words against a 180-word
cap), which is what buried the finding under the text around it. The prepare-pr
extractor already reads `Not justified as shipped` as an item-bearing section, so
the local loop's per-item dispositions are unchanged; the check-run summary and the
`::warning` annotation publish that section in place of `Watch`.

Two mechanical guards back the contract in all six whole-design lanes (both First
Principles, Design and UX workflows). The captured model text is **trimmed to its
verdict header** before it is posted, so process narration a model writes above the
header ("All facts verified against the base. Composing the final review.") never
reaches the PR; a body with no header is left whole so the existing
"returned no verdict header" path still sees it. And the prose **outside the collapsed
`<details>` inventory is counted**: past twice the lane's cap (180 words for First
Principles, 150 for Design and UX) the job emits a `::warning` naming the count. It
is a warning, not a gate -- the verdict and the comment do not move -- because the
cap is a readability contract, not a correctness one. The Design and UX punchlines
follow the same problem-first rule as First Principles: for `CONCERNS`/`BLOCK` the
sentence opens with the problem, never `<what is sound>, but <problem>`; for `PASS`
it names the one thing a human should still verify, or `Nothing to check.`

**Where it overlaps Design Review, this lane owns the question.** Design Review's own
rubric asks whether a change fixes a root cause and whether a simpler alternative
exists; those questions are asked here from the premise side and per item. The split
is deliberate — premise and cause here, shape quality there — and if the two lanes
converge in practice, the answer is to trim the overlap out of Design Review, not to
tune two prompts against each other.

### Why Opus 4.8 is code-only

It is the agentic reviewer, so pulling attacker-controllable PR prose into its
context is a prompt-injection surface. `gh pr view` and `gh api` are disallowed, and
so is `gh pr comment`: a **CI step**, not the model, upserts a single
hidden-marker-keyed summary captured from the run transcript, which trades scattered
inline chatter for one terse summary plus a binary gate. The PR-intent
responsibility, including flagging a description-versus-diff mismatch, is
deliberately handed to the read-only, non-agentic GPT 5.6 reviewer, which treats
that prose as **untrusted evidence, never authority to waive a code finding**. The
prose is fetched by a step that has network and the token, then baked into the
prompt wrapped in a collision-resistant nonce, because the review sandbox unshares
the network and cannot fetch it itself.

### One shared binary contract

Both line reviewers run the same review contract, and severity encodes exactly one
thing: *does this block the merge*, **never confidence**. There is no
"possible issue" tier. The blocks of that contract shared by the two GPT
workflows — the diff-is-not-evidence clause, the coverage/finding/fix bars, the
output contract, and the falsification-pass mandate and verdict framing — live in
shared `.github/review-prompts/gpt-*.md` files rather than as two inline copies,
so the lanes cannot drift apart on them (#5852). The same-repo lane's remaining
inline chunks (its system rules, repo context, and round-convergence sections)
moved into that directory too (#3697), so its whole prompt is now assembled by
splicing staged prompt files in a fixed order — which is also what lets the
prepare-pr skill's `local_review.py` mirror the contract by reading the same
files instead of scraping shell heredocs. The same-repo lane stages them
from the PR's **base** commit like the Opus lanes; unlike those lanes it falls
back to the checked-out copy (with a warning) when a block is absent on the base,
because a hard gate cannot afford a no-verdict pass and, on a same-repo PR, the
workflow file itself is already editable by the PR — the fallback adds no attack
surface the lane did not have. The fork lane's checkout *is* the trusted base
(the diff is never applied), so it reads the files straight from the tree and
fails closed if one is missing. A finding must state a concrete input or condition that
occurs in practice, the call path to the changed line, and an observable wrong
outcome; anything phrased as "could", "might" or "if a caller were to" is **not a
finding**, and silence is the correct output. Only two labels exist: **BLOCKING**
(on the closed WHAT BLOCKS list) and **FINDING** (advisory, never blocks). A
per-review budget caps a review at 2 BLOCKING findings, and the calibration note
says "No findings." is the expected output for a typical PR.

### Asymmetric multi-pass is intentional

BOTH line reviewers now run **two real invocations**: a discovery pass that
generates candidates, then an **authoritative falsification** pass whose primary
job is to *kill* them. The Opus lane used to run one pass with two internal phases; that
was measured on this repo to suppress findings the same model reports reliably
without the precision clauses, because a prompt asked to discover AND to police
its own precision stops discovering. Its discovery half therefore carries no
precision gates, and its validation half applies a confidence floor and the closed
blocking list. A
candidate survives only if pass 2 re-derived the input, the call path and the
observable outcome itself from code it opened in that pass. Pass 2 may also *add* a
defect discovery missed, in both lanes, but only under that same three-part
grounding and the same confidence floor — killing a candidate stays its primary
job, and a self-found finding gets no second opinion, so it earns no cheaper path
in. In both lanes such a finding is tagged `(origin: validation)` in the posted
review, because it is un-falsified by construction: the tag is what lets a reader
weight it accordingly, and what lets the precision of self-added findings be
compared against survivors' rather than assumed equal. Pass 2 is the only
gated verdict. Falsification raises precision *within a single run*, which is why
neither reviewer carries cross-round state: each judges only the current SHA's code
and therefore cannot contradict itself across rounds.

### Verdicts are structured markers

The markers are the **only** gate:

- Opus 4.8 emits `[OPUS-REVIEWED] <sha>` always, and `[BLOCK-MERGE] <sha>` only when a
  blocking finding exists. Both are parsed out of the action's `execution_file`
  transcript rather than a `--json-schema` structured output, because the harness's
  internal structured-output tool is unreliable when other tools are enabled:
  reviews completed with a success result yet returned no structured output,
  failing this gate closed on healthy reviews.
- GPT 5.6 emits `[GPT-REVIEWED] <sha>` / `[BLOCK-MERGE] <sha>`. When the provider
  *refuses* the request — declines to review the diff because of what it contains,
  as opposed to crashing or timing out — the **same-repo lane** publishes a distinct
  terminal state: the synthetic verdict body names the refusal in prose (no
  reviewed marker, so the gate still fails closed), and the classification rides
  the verdict assembly's `refused` step output. There is deliberately no refusal
  marker in the body — the body on the clean path is model prose, and a marker
  would invite prose-grepping, so a review that merely quotes the refusal wording
  cannot be reclassified. The gate's message names human adjudication
  (`/ai-review override`) instead of advising a re-run: the refusal is caused by
  the reviewed content and is empirically sticky — 12 consecutive identical
  refusals across 10 heads were measured on one PR — so a re-run is not a workable
  remedy. A failed pass is classified as refused only when the provider's own
  error line appears line-anchored in the tail of that pass's captured stream,
  because the stream also carries PR-controlled text (the prompt embeds the PR
  title/body, and the reviewer echoes the diff). Without the distinction, every
  security fix whose evidence is a working exploit read as a permanently
  re-runnable crash (#8685). The fork GPT lane (`fork-gpt-review.yml`) still
  reports only the generic incomplete state and is tracked separately.
- Design and UX emit `Design-Verdict:` / `UX-Verdict: PASS | CONCERNS | BLOCK`,
  parsed from a header line.

A missing reviewed-marker for the current head fails the gate closed, because a
no-output review must not look clean. A BLOCKING-labelled finding without the
`[BLOCK-MERGE]` marker is only a non-gating **advisory warning**, since a coherence
check on that pairing mis-fires whenever the model quotes prior text.

The Opus discovery pass has its own marker, `[OPUS-DISCOVERY] <sha>`, and the
`Capture discovery candidates` step fails closed when it is absent, before
validation runs. That branch keeps its existing `::error::` line and `exit 1`, and
in addition prints one `::notice::discovery-capture-diagnostics` line. The line
carries fixed keys only: the execution file's shape (`absent`, `empty`, `array`,
`object`, `jsonl`, `other`, `unparseable`), the captured byte count, how many
transcript messages carry a `result`, the number of `compact_boundary` system
messages, the number of permission denials, that same number split by the
denied tool (`denied_read`, `denied_grep`, `denied_glob`, `denied_bash`, each an
exact `tool_name` match, and `denied_other` for every other name, a missing or
non-string name, or a malformed entry; the five sum to `permission_denials` and
no recorded name is ever echoed), whether the full marker appears in at least
one assistant `text` block of the transcript (`marker_in_assistant`), and four
measurements of the text the extraction itself produced before
redaction: its character count, and whether the full marker, a short-SHA marker
or the literal `<HEAD_SHA>` placeholder appears in it. That text is the shell
variable the marker grep was fed, so on a JSONL transcript it is every record's
`.result` concatenated and a non-string result is the JSON `jq -r` rendered,
exactly as the candidate file sees them. It reaches jq over stdin, never as a
process argument. Each value is a count, a boolean or one word from a closed
set, validated by shape before it is echoed; a file jq cannot parse yields
`unparseable` and `unknown` transcript counts, never jq's error text. Counts
that come from `wc` are stripped of the padding BSD `wc` (macOS) adds before
they are echoed, so every token on the line is one `key=value` pair on every
platform. A `true` full-marker value on this branch means the capture, not the
model, lost the marker (the redactor rewrote it). A `true` `marker_in_assistant`
with a `false` full-marker value means a scanned assistant text block contains
it but the extracted result does not. It does not establish message order or
prove review completeness. `false` says only that no scanned `text` block
carried it. In both cases the
gate still fails and nothing lifts a marker out of an earlier message. A
`compact_boundaries` of `0` means no `compact_boundary` message was observed in
the file; it is not proof of anything the transcript does not record. The
success path still prints the redacted candidate file as a tuning signal, as
before; the failing branch prints no transcript or candidate content, and neither
path uploads the execution file.
`test_ai_review_workflows.py::TestOpusDiscoveryCaptureExecutes` runs the real
step against fixtures that plant sentinel strings in the tool arguments, denied
tool names, tool results and the model's text, and asserts none reach stdout or
stderr; one case runs the step with a `wc` shim that pads like BSD `wc` and
asserts the line still parses one token per key. The same block runs verbatim in
`fork-opus-review.yml` as trusted workflow text; it never executes a helper from
the fork's tree.

What the first diagnostics line said. On
[PR #10586](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/10586) the same-repo
discovery pass lost its marker at two heads
([run 34787154779](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/actions/runs/34787154779),
[run 34791198099](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/actions/runs/34791198099)).
Observed on the second: `exec_file=array captured_bytes=294 result_messages=1
extracted_chars=293 marker_in_extracted=false short_sha_marker_only=false
placeholder_marker=false compact_boundaries=0 permission_denials=4`, with a
result message reporting 19 turns and `is_error: false`. The extraction selected
the one result message the transcript had; that message did not contain the
marker; the redactor did not rewrite one. The capture is not where the marker
went. What the 293 characters said, and which four tool calls were denied, is
not observable from that run, by design; the per-tool denial counts exist so
the next occurrence answers the second question. The two marker-less passes
were also the two with the largest prefetched diffs on that PR (996,100 and
1,093,568 bytes against 466,134 to 778,441 bytes for the passes that produced
the marker) and the fewest turns (19 against 26 to 62). That is a correlation
across two heads, not a mechanism: the diagnostics do not measure what the
model read or how much context it used, and this page does not claim the diff
exceeded the model's context. The prompt
(`.github/review-prompts/opus-discovery.md`, read from the base commit, so a PR
cannot change the prompt that reviews it) defines two output shapes, a
candidate list or `No candidates.`, each ending in the marker and each described
as the product of inspecting every hunk; a pass that stops short of that has no
conforming shape. A short free-text final message is one hypothesis consistent
with these numbers, and it is unconfirmed. No reading of the diagnostics line
changes the verdict.

A lane's summary comment is **one slot shared by every run on the PR**, and it
is upserted in place. The comments API has no `If-Match`, so a write to that
slot is last-writer-wins, and it exposes no edit history, so the loss is
undetectable afterwards: a failed run's "review incomplete" body once replaced
a posted verdict and a `[BLOCK-MERGE]` finding vanished from every surface a
reader or tool checks (#8292).

Eight of the ten lanes that upsert a verdict comment now let exactly one kind of
run claim that slot — a **completed verdict for the PR's current head**. The two
other kinds each lose a live verdict, so each leaves an existing comment
untouched (#8344):

- **No `"<stamp> <head>"` proof marker** — a review failure. Preserving the
  verdict and prepending a staleness notice is *not* a safe alternative: it
  reads the body and writes a merge of it back, so a verdict published between
  the read and the write is restored away.
- **A completed verdict for a superseded head** — the same loss arriving late.
  An older run can finish after a newer one published, because the fork lanes'
  `concurrency` group is keyed per head so they are not cancelled, and a
  cancelled same-repo run still executes its `if: always()` posting step. The
  step reads the PR's head and stands down when it is not the head it
  reviewed.
- **A head that cannot be read.** Writing is the destructive half of the
  guard, so it does not proceed on an unknown: a head unreadable after three
  attempts is *not confirmed current* and the slot is left alone. The read
  retries first — with the same bounded backoff this lane's other gating reads
  use — because one blip is not evidence about the PR, and an API broken
  enough to fail all three would fail the write too.

Whether a comment exists is the other gating input, so that read retries on the
same bounded backoff. A lookup still erroring afterwards counts as "a comment
may exist", not as "none does", so a withheld run posts nothing rather than
plant a second marker comment over a possibly-live verdict. When the lookup
succeeded and found nothing there is no verdict to lose, so the body is posted
as a new comment. Nothing is lost by standing down: the comment names the head
it reviewed, each head's own check-run is finalized fail-closed, and
`pr_status.py` matches reviewer stamps against the current head, so a comment
left in place for an older head reads as *stale* and never as an approval of
this one.

Human overrides and skip notices are current-head determinations rather than
review failures, so their upsert sites keep replacing the comment
unconditionally, and a completed verdict for a **confirmed** current head whose
*comment* lookup failed still CREATEs rather than stay silent (a duplicate
comment is recoverable, an unposted verdict is not). The eight guarded lanes
define the guard as a `guarded_comment_upsert` bash function that
`test_ai_review_workflows.py` pins byte-identical across every lane, so the
invariant cannot drift lane by lane.

Two lanes stay outside that function, and both exclusions are deliberate:

- **`codex-review.yml`** carries #8342's own inline preserve-and-prepend shape,
  pinned byte-for-byte by its own tests — it is the one site left with a
  read-modify-write window on the slot.
- **`claude-review.yml`** keeps a plain lookup-then-PATCH. Its incomplete path
  posts **nothing at all**, so the #8292 class — a failure notice burying a
  verdict — cannot reach it. What remains is only the superseded-completed
  window: its `concurrency` group cancels an older run per PR, but the posting
  step is `if: always()`, which a cancelled run still executes, so an older run
  holding a completed verdict can still claim the slot.

### Security posture of the reviewer jobs

- Explicit fork guards (`head.repo.full_name == github.repository`) on **every
  step**, so on a fork the job starts and then does nothing rather than failing an
  unsatisfiable credential step. The guard is per-step and not job-level because
  GitHub never evaluates a **skipped** job's `name:` -- while it was job-level,
  every fork PR published the raw name expression as its check name. Fork coverage
  still comes from the separate `fork-*` pipeline below.
- **The job name is conditional on the head repository**, so a fork PR gets
  `<check> (same-repo lane, not applicable to forks)` instead of the protected
  name. Same-repo PRs keep the exact protected name. Without this, both lanes
  publish one name and GitHub resolves a required status check to the **newest**
  check-run of that name: a `pull_request` event firing after the fork lane
  posted its verdict (a reopen, or an `edited` title/body on `codex-review.yml`)
  would make the same-repo lane's own run the newest one and satisfy the
  gate on a review that never ran. `pr-readiness.yml` was never fooled by this
  -- for a fork it reads only the check-runs bound to this PR and attempt by
  `external_id` and treats "no completed bound run" as pending -- so the rename
  closes the branch-protection half of the gate.
- `persist-credentials: false` on checkout, so `actions/checkout` never writes the
  token into `.git/config` where a reviewer reading untrusted PR content could find
  it.
- AUTOSDE rules are extracted from the **base** commit, not the PR head, so a PR
  cannot weaken the rules that govern it.
- Bedrock credentials are assumed late, after dependency installation, so a
  compromised or version-drifted release never observes them.
- The GPT reviewer runs in a read-only, network-unshared sandbox (which is why the
  job clears `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` first: the sandbox's
  bubblewrap fails at netns setup otherwise).
- Review output is redacted for AWS key ids, ARNs, 12-digit account numbers and
  secret-key or session-token shapes before any public comment.
- Dependabot PRs skip the review work and let the gate pass, since they run with a
  read-only token and no credential access.
- A 90-minute job timeout is a runaway backstop, not a review budget: a healthy
  review self-terminates well before it, so the timeout exists solely to fail the
  gate closed on a true hang.

### Advisory means advisory, with one exception

Design Review and UX Review are advisory except on `BLOCK`: their suggestions must be
proportionate ("never recommend extra layers, abstractions or future-proofing the
problem does not require"), and their tie-breaker is to choose `CONCERNS` over
`BLOCK` when torn, reaching for `BLOCK` only when the **design** or the **experience**
is wrong and never merely because the change is large. A genuine `BLOCK` verdict
fails that workflow's own check and `pr-readiness.yml` scores that failure as a
readiness blocker; every other outcome exits 0.

One class is exempt from the tie-breaker in both lanes and in First Principles:
**a verdict the lane cannot reach because required evidence is missing is a
`BLOCK`, never a `CONCERNS`.** A UI diff with no screenshot of the controls it adds
(UX lens 12), a persistent-element state change with no recording (UX lens 13), a
reshaped user-visible surface the Design reviewer has never seen rendered -- each is
`cannot evaluate: missing <X>`. Filed as `CONCERNS`, an unevaluated change reads as
"looked and found little" and passes readiness green; PR #5185 shipped 44
`website/src/` files that way, with the UX lane itself recording that the blind read
never ran. Absence of evidence is read off the screenshot list, the recording list
and the description, not judged, so it is a fact and the lanes report it as one.
The Design trigger accepts the same evidence the UX lane admits: a
`github.com/user-attachments` asset in the description or an image committed at
HEAD -- and it reads presence the same way. Both Design lanes run a "Collect
rendered evidence" step that sources the shared allowlisted fetch script, downloads
and types every attachment the description offers, lists the committed images the
revision adds or changes (same-repo only; the fork head is never checked out), and
writes one evidence file the prompt is told to read; the description's text is not
the predicate, so a fabricated or dead URL does not count as evidence. A transport
failure is listed as "presence unconfirmed" and caps the Design verdict at `CONCERNS`
rather than failing the lane, because the UX lane fails its run on the same failure
and readiness already holds. An image hosted off a commit outside the PR, or one the
description says shows another PR, is not evidence of this revision.

**Design Review owns the long-term / one-way-door lens** as its gate 8, "LONG-TERM
REVERSIBILITY", in both the same-repo and fork variants. An unsafe one-way door is
its primary `BLOCK` trigger. Everything reversible (architectural erosion,
maintainability, "should eventually be refactored") is advice and non-blocking
follow-up work, because the author does not need a perfect or complete solution in
this PR.

There is no separate long-term arbiter workflow. A second-order reviewer that
re-judged the other reviewers' *comments* over a `workflow_run` chain blocked almost
nothing, and it structurally could not work for fork PRs: the fork head SHA does not
survive the extra `workflow_run` hop, so it never resolved which PR it was for. The
lens now lives where the reviewer already has full diff context, and covers same-repo
and fork PRs identically with no cross-workflow head-passing.

### `UX Review` early-skips cheaply

It runs only when the diff touches `website/`, `temp-screenshots/**` or
`.github/screenshots/**` (the last two are gitignored, so in practice `website/` is the
trigger). A backend, CI or docs PR skips it with no model call and no comment churn,
and the check passes. Review evidence is uploaded as a GitHub attachment, not
committed: the author writes local paths in the PR body and runs
`gh pr create|edit --attach <path>`, which rewrites each into a permanent
`https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/...` URL (dragging the file into the
description in the web UI yields the same URL). The lane reads the body from the API when
it runs (`.github/scripts/pr-attachment-evidence.sh`, one script both UX lanes source;
the fork lane takes it from its trusted base checkout), not from the event payload -- an `edited` event starts no review, so evidence
attached after a push is read on a re-run of the workflow or on the next push -- downloads
those URLs (a committed image is still accepted), reads each one and grounds visual
findings in them, and it is instructed to treat screenshot content as untrusted (a
screenshot, title, commit message or filename attempting to grant leniency is
ignored, and screenshot polish never waives a lens). `screenshot-evidence.yml`, the
gate that requires evidence on a UI diff, accepts the same URLs.

A diff that changes an Electron-only surface -- the application menu, its
accelerator captions, the window chrome -- cannot be photographed by any of the
`website/scripts/capture-*.mjs` scripts, which all drive the web app in Chromium.
`website/scripts/capture-electron-shell.mjs` shoots those surfaces by launching
real Electron; the recipe is in
[worktree verification recipes](../guides/worktree-verification-recipes.md).

### `UX Review` reads the screenshots blind before it reads the diff

On same-repo PRs the lane is two model calls with a context wall between them.
**Pass 1 (blind read)** gets the `Read` tool and a list of the images the PR carries
-- the `user-attachments` URLs linked from its body, downloaded to the runner, plus
any image it commits -- copied under opaque names (`shot-01.png`, ...) so an
author-chosen filename such as `pinned-turn-chip.png` cannot prime it -- and nothing
else: no diff, no PR title or description, no `Grep`/`Glob`/`Bash`. It is told it is
a non-technical person opening the product for the first time and
writes down, per element, what it appears to be, what a click would do, how sure it
is, and whether it would dare to click. **Pass 2 (reconcile)** gets the diff, the PR
text and pass 1's report as a data file, and adjudicates rather than re-reads.

Why the wall exists: PR #6783 minimized a banner into a corner chip labelled
"Pinned turn". Every AI lane passed it -- this one wrote that the chip was
"self-teaching ... visibly labelled" -- and the product owner could not tell what the
chip was. A reviewer that has read the diff and the description before it looks at
the pixels has already learned the author's vocabulary; it can check that a label
exists, is localized and is reversible, but it can no longer test whether a stranger
understands it. The old lens 12 ("five-second proxy: imagine an uninformed reader")
asked exactly that of a reviewer that was no longer uninformed, so it was replaced.

Three rules follow from the split, all read off evidence rather than judged:

- **Coverage.** Every user-visible control the diff adds or changes must appear in a
  screenshot the PR carries -- an attachment linked from its body, or a committed
  image. One that does not is an *evidence gap*, listed under
  `### Evidence gaps`, and the verdict is `BLOCK` -- `cannot evaluate: missing <the
  control>` -- because a lane that has not seen a control cannot judge it and a
  verdict it cannot reach must not read as advisory. The same holds for a lens-13
  state change with no recording, and for a blind read not performed because the PR
  supplied no admissible image. A blind read that was *unavailable* -- images admitted
  and pass 1 itself failed -- is the lane's own failure, not the author's gap: it caps
  at `CONCERNS` and a re-run of the workflow is the remedy. When *any* attachment
  download from the description fails for a transport reason (5xx, 403/408/429, no
  answer; a definite 404 is the author's URL), the same-repo evidence step **fails the
  run** instead of asking the prompt to cap the verdict or to exempt the controls that
  attachment would have shown: a lane that could not see everything the author
  supplied must not read as advisory, so the check is red, readiness holds, and a
  re-run is the remedy -- exactly as a hard model-step error is handled. A download
  that fails the same way on the re-run is the attachment URL itself, which the
  author fixes. The fork
  lane holds the same way: its evidence step fails on the same condition and its
  Finalize step completes the check-run as `failure` (an errored fork run would
  otherwise resolve `neutral`, which readiness scores as pass), so a fork UI change
  the lane could not evaluate does not merge on the strength of a throttled asset
  host either; a maintainer re-runs the lane. An image
  the evidence step did not admit (not a `user-attachments` asset, not committed at
  HEAD -- e.g. a raw URL pinned to a commit outside the PR) does not close a gap. A
  diff that adds or changes no user-visible control has no gaps and needs no
  screenshot.
- **Primary controls.** A control on the change's main path that the blind reader
  misread (named a different thing or outcome than the diff implements), could not
  identify, or would not dare to click is a `BLOCK`, quoting the reader's words. A
  correct reading the reader rated only "a guess", secondary misreads, and
  vocabulary collisions ("Pinned turn" next to the existing "Pinned messages") are
  `CONCERNS`.
- **State-transition continuity (lens 13).** When a user action or state flip
  minimizes, collapses, relocates or replaces a *persistent* element the user has
  already identified, the change must animate *one* element between the two states
  (shared layout, a landing spot the eye can follow, continuous text, restore as the
  reverse), respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`. A hard swap in the diff
  (`flag ? <Chip/> : <Card/>`, an unmount/mount with no shared-element transition)
  with no stated reason is a `BLOCK`. Async lifecycle states (loading, empty, error
  -> content) are not in scope. The convention is also stated in `website/AGENTS.md`
  so authors meet it before the check does. Static screenshots cannot show
  continuity, so this class of change needs a recording (a `.gif`/`.mp4`/`.webm`
  attached to the PR body, or committed); none is an evidence gap. The reviewer
  cannot play the recording -- it verifies the mechanism in the diff and that the
  recording exists, and a human watches it.

The fork lane (`fork-ux-review.yml`) carries the same rules but has **no blind-read
pass**: it reviews in a single pass, after the diff. Its evidence step reads the PR
description from the API and downloads the allowlisted `user-attachments` URLs onto
the runner (the job's egress allowlist names the two hosts a download touches,
`github.com` and the `github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com` bucket
its 302 points at), so the reviewer
opens the same images a same-repo review would. An image a fork PR *commits* is not
on disk -- the fork head is never checked out -- so a control shown only there is an
evidence gap, which is a `BLOCK` (`cannot evaluate`) the author closes by attaching
the image to the description. A control the attachments *do* show but no blind
reader has read caps the fork PR at `CONCERNS`: that is the lane's limitation, not
the author's gap, so it does not block. A maintainer who wants
the blind read pushes the branch to this repository. A fork contributor without push
access cannot run `gh --attach`; dragging the file into the PR description in the web
UI yields the same `user-attachments` URL.

The PR identity (number, repository, shas, data-file paths) is passed to both passes
in `--append-system-prompt`, not in `prompt:`. GitHub rejects a workflow file
silently (zero jobs, nothing on the PR) when any expression-bearing string exceeds
21000 characters, and the review prompt is past that once it carries these rules, so
`prompt:` must stay expression-free.

### Human override

`ai-review-human-override.yml` lets a repository **writer** record a judgment with:

```
/ai-review override <fable|gpt|design|ux|first-principles|scope|all> <current-head-sha>: <one-sentence reason>
```

`scope` targets the [Security Scope Review](#security-scope-review-what-a-tightening-newly-refuses) lanes; every target maps to its like-named reviewer.

`issue_comment` workflows execute from the trusted default branch, never from the PR
head. The handler validates the command shape, a 7-to-40-hex SHA that must be the
**current** head, writer-or-above permission, and a non-empty reason under 500
characters, then posts a **bot-authored** marker comment that the reviewer workflows
trust. Raw PR comments can never turn a gate green directly; only that marker can.
The scope is **this commit only**, so a new push needs a new judgment. The workflow
then re-runs the affected reviewer, cancelling an in-flight run first so its stale
verdict cannot race the human decision. On a fork PR the affected reviewer is the
`workflow_run`-triggered Stage-2 lane, whose run objects are keyed to the default
branch — the handler locates the lane run through the run URL the lane stamps into
the `details_url` of the check-run it posts on the PR head, verifies the resolved
run belongs to the expected fork workflow, and re-runs it. The fork lanes consume
no override marker, so that re-run is a fresh review roll rather than a forced
pass. A rerun failure after the judgment has recorded is reported as a warning
annotation plus a PR notice naming the lane to re-run manually — never as a failed
run, which would make a recorded judgment look rejected.
`test/test_ai_review_workflows.py` pins the contract from both ends:
`test_handler_requires_write_permission_fresh_sha_and_reason` for the authorization and
freshness checks, and `test_fable_consumes_only_a_bot_authored_sha_scoped_record` plus
`test_gpt_has_clear_verdict_banner_and_human_override` for the consumer side, so an
untrusted PR comment or a decision for an earlier push cannot turn a gate green.

## `Security Scope Review`: what a tightening newly refuses

A security fix is almost always a deny rule made stricter, and "stricter" has a
cost no reviewer sees by reading the pattern: the set of ordinary operations the
tightened rule *also* newly refuses — a read-only `gh` query, a feature-branch
push, an installed cron. This lane names them. It asks one question — which
legitimate operations does this change newly refuse? — and answers it against the
real deny composite at the base ref and at the head ref, on macOS, Linux and
Windows.

It does **not** judge whether the fix is secure enough, and it does not replace
the [denial-differential gate](denial-differential.md). The denial differential
classifies a committed corpus of known golden paths; this lane has a model
**propose** candidate legitimate operations the corpus does not yet name, and
`scripts/deny_diff.py` **decides** each one by classifying it at both refs. Model
proposes, script decides: a candidate is data the classifier reads, never an
operation it runs, so a confirmed regression is the script's finding and never the
model's.

It runs on two surfaces. `.github/workflows/security-scope-review.yml` is the
same-repo lane. `.github/workflows/fork-security-scope-review.yml` gives a fork PR
the same review from the trusted base branch, triggered by the completion of
`Fast Gate` and gated on `head_repository.full_name != github.repository`, and it
posts under the same check name so branch protection is satisfied on either path.

### Scope

The lane runs only when the change touches the security surface: the deny
composite's own modules (`src/kiro_crew/security/`, `src/kiro_crew/hooks.py`,
`src/kiro_crew/deny_guidance.py`,
`src/kiro_crew/platform/security_authority.py`), the security-conductor's
`rules-of-engagement.json` and `golden-paths.json`, and the lane's own harness
(`scripts/deny_diff.py`, `scripts/scope_candidates.py`, `scripts/scope_redact.py`,
`.github/review-prompts/security-scope.md`, and this workflow). A tightening can
also live outside those paths, so the `security-scope-review` label forces the
lane on. The surface list is a sentinel-delimited array in the same-repo workflow,
and the fork lane reads that one array from the base commit, so the two lanes
scope one surface rather than two that drift. A change that touches nothing on the
surface and carries no label resolves "nothing to scope" and passes.

### Four jobs, split by what each may hold

The job graph is `generate` → `validate` → `adjudicate` → `publish`, and the split
is a trust boundary: the job that holds the Bedrock credential runs no repository
Python, and the job that can write a comment runs only base-committed harness.

| Job | Holds | Runs | Platform |
|---|---|---|---|
| `generate` | the Bedrock credential (`id-token: write`) | Fable 5, which proposes `candidates.json` reading with `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` | ubuntu |
| `validate` | `contents: read` | `scope_candidates.py validate`, which proves the model's file is a corpus the differential can consume | ubuntu |
| `adjudicate` | `contents: read` | `deny_diff.py`, classifying each candidate at the base ref and the head ref | ubuntu, macOS, windows |
| `publish` | `pull-requests: write` | the fold and comment assembly, staged from the base commit | ubuntu |

The model is `us.anthropic.claude-fable-5`, with `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` as
the overload fallback. `generate` mints the credential but runs no repository
Python, so a prompt injection reaches no product code. `validate` and `adjudicate`
execute the change's own harness — `adjudicate` materializes each ref's own
`kiro_crew.security` into its own directory and classifies against it in a child
process — but hold no credential and no write token, so a judge supplied by the
change under judgement decides nothing worth stealing. `publish` holds the only
write token and reads every program it runs out of a committed base-commit blob,
so the change under review cannot supply the code that folds its own verdict.
`adjudicate`'s legs do not fail-fast: one platform's regression is not evidence
about another's, and the path fence's home-directory ordering and the argv
tokenizer differ per OS.

### The verdict, and why it fails closed

The review emits `[SCOPE-REVIEWED] <sha>` and a `Scope-Verdict: PASS | CONCERNS |
BLOCK` header. The header is the model's opinion and never a gate on its own. The
gate is the differential: a script-confirmed newly-refused operation reds the lane
whatever the model wrote. A model `BLOCK` with no confirmed regression scores
CONCERNS unless it stands on a demonstrated platform gap; a clean fold with a
`PASS` header and a marker for this head passes.

Every outcome that could not settle a verdict — a fold that errored, a confirmed
row that had to be redacted, a platform leg that never reported, or a review that
left no `[SCOPE-REVIEWED]` marker for this head — routes through one constant,
`_UNSETTLED_CONCLUSION` in `scripts/scope_candidates.py`. It is the strict value,
and both lanes map it to a **failing check**. That is the fail-closed contract:
"could not run" and "found nothing" are the same badge to a reader, so they must
not be the same exit code — an unmeasured tightening must not read as "nothing
newly refused". The conclusion table lives in one place,
`scope_candidates.py conclude`, which both lanes call, so a fork can never resolve
more permissively than same-repo.

**That strict value is a ruling, not a default.** Fail-closed was chosen over
resolving neutral, with the cost named: a Bedrock outage or one flaky matrix leg
reds the lane on a PR whose scope may be fine. On a fork PR a re-run clears it: a
run that could not measure marks its own check-run unsettled (a
`[scope-floor:unsettled]` prefix on `output.title`), so the per-head floor does
not stand behind that run and a later clean run publishes clean. On a same-repo
PR the floor's state is the publish job's own check-run conclusion, which the run
cannot mark, so a re-run alone cannot clear a prior flake there — the escape is
the SHA-scoped `/ai-review override scope <sha>`, which bypasses the floor. It is
worth paying on three grounds. It is the failure this lane exists to catch, so the lane
must not commit it about itself. Its blast radius is bounded to the population that
needs the strictness — `generate` resolves `in_scope=false` for a change outside the
security surface, and every step that mints a credential or calls the model is gated
on that answer, so an off-surface PR spends no Bedrock call and completes green
without a model verdict. It is not a workflow-level skip: the cheap deterministic
steps still run, which is deliberate, because a lane reporting `skipped` is read as
"the review has not posted yet" and waited on. What the gate buys is that the two
failure sources this ruling is about — an outage and a flaky matrix leg — cannot red
a PR the lane would not have judged. And
it matches `Opus 4.8 Review` and `GPT 5.6 Review`, both fail-closed in the table
above; a security lane resolving softer than them would be the weakest link in the
same rollup. To reverse the ruling, set `_UNSETTLED_CONCLUSION = "concerns"` — one
constant, no other edit, both lanes already map `concerns` to a non-blocking
neutral. That stays one constant on purpose: `conclude` reports `settled=no` by
comparing against the constant rather than against a token spelling, so the fork
lane keeps marking unsettled runs after a flip instead of silently treating them as
measured. The same-repo floor is indifferent to the value — its state is the job's
own conclusion, and any non-`success` prior floors the head — so `/ai-review
override scope <sha>` remains that lane's escape either way.

### When it goes red

Read the lane's comment. Each row is an operation the classifier confirms `<sha>`
newly refuses, with the tier that refused it and the refusal text. Narrow the rule
so it no longer catches the row. A human who has judged the scope acceptable by
hand records `/ai-review override scope <current-sha>: <reason>` on the same-repo
lane.

**A fork PR's override does not clear this lane yet**, and that is a gap rather than
a rule. The fork lane consumes no override marker today, so a scope judged acceptable
on a fork clears only by re-raising the change from a branch in this repository —
where the same-repo lane does honour the override — or by a maintainer with admin
rights dismissing the required check. It is worth being exact about why, because the
lane used to claim a threat it does not have: the marker is posted by
`ai-review-human-override.yml` as `github-actions[bot]` after that workflow checks the
commenter's write permission, and the same-repo lane authenticates it by that bot
login on this repository's own comment feed, read with this repository's token and
pinned to one head SHA. Nothing in that chain depends on the pull request being
same-repo. Reading it on the fork lane is missing work, tracked in #10109, not a
door held shut. A *transient* failure needs none of this: such a run marks its own
check-run `[scope-floor:unsettled]`, sets no per-head floor, and clears on a re-run.

## `pr-readiness.yml`: the aggregator

It executes no tests. It resolves the PR's current head SHA, **drops stale events**,
queries the latest run per monitored workflow, and publishes **one `PR Readiness`
commit status plus one `readiness:` label**.

- **Always required:** Fast Gate, CI, Build, Code Review. `Fast Gate` is a lane in
  its own right and not merely CI's precondition — a red gate must red the PR, and
  `await-fast-gate` reports `failure` rather than the gate that actually broke, so
  the readable verdict has to come from the gate workflow itself. It carries CI's
  `branches: [main]` filter, so it sits in the same stacked-PR carve-out: on a PR
  whose base is not the default branch it never starts, and a monitored lane that
  reads `(not started)` would freeze the verdict at pending forever.
- **Additionally required on a same-repo PR:** CodeQL, Opus 4.8 Review, GPT 5.6
  Review, Security Scope Review, and completion of Design Review, UX Review and
  First Principles Review.
- **Design Review, UX Review and First Principles Review are completion-required
  AND block on a genuine `BLOCK`:** the aggregator scores each lane's `failure`
  conclusion as a readiness blocker. Each lane's status step fails the check on a
  `BLOCK` verdict and exits 0 on `PASS`, `CONCERNS` or a verdict-less run; the
  same-repo lanes additionally go red when the model step itself errors (no
  `continue-on-error`, so a review that did not run is an honest red that a re-run
  clears, never a verdict), while the fork lanes resolve such a run to `neutral` --
  with one deliberate exception: the fork UX lane completes as `failure` when an
  attachment download failed for a transport reason, because a change the lane could
  not evaluate must not read as advisory.
  So a `failure` means a design judged wrong, an experience judged broken, a surface
  judged unjustified, a change the lane could not evaluate on the evidence supplied,
  or -- same-repo only -- a review that errored before producing a verdict.
  Where this was decided: the aggregator has scored these three lanes' `failure` as a
  readiness blocker since it began reading them (`pr-readiness.yml`, the Design / UX /
  First Principles branch of the check-run reader), which is what turned them from
  advisory into gates; the evidence-gap and product-shape rules in the prompts are
  the verdict-side counterpart of that promotion (issue #10476), so that a lane which
  could not evaluate a change reaches the verdict the aggregator already enforces.
  The rollback for those rules is one revert of that change; the aggregator's scoring
  is unaffected by it.
- **Security Scope Review is required and fails closed:** the aggregator scores
  its `failure` as a plain blocker, because that conclusion covers both a
  script-confirmed newly-refused operation and a run that measured nothing — an
  errored fold, a missing head marker, or a platform leg that never reported.
  It is deliberately not relabelled `(BLOCK)` the way Design Review is, because
  a `failure` here does not always mean a verdict was reached.
- **CodeQL is not a checked-in workflow.** It runs via GitHub default setup. The
  aggregator first resolves the analysis run by
  `path == "dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql"`, then reads the exact head SHA's
  `CodeQL` check from the `github-advanced-security` app. A successful analysis
  run does not mask a failed security result. An absent, running, or interim
  neutral result remains `checking`; `skipped` still counts as passed for the
  managed workflow.
- **Labels:** `readiness: checking` (pending), `readiness: action required` (a
  blocker), `readiness: passed`. Exactly one is ever present.
- **It also enforces the disposition rule.** Besides scoring lanes, readiness runs
  `pr_status.py --disposition-gate` (checked out from the default branch, never
  from the PR head — this workflow is `pull_request_target` and holds write
  tokens) and folds each violation of the one-lane / one-rationale-per-finding
  rule into its blocking list. That is the only enforcement point that binds a
  writer who never runs the prepare-pr loop, which is what a blanket
  single-rationale record used to escape through (#6658). The rule keeps ONE
  implementation: the readiness step calls the same script the local gate does
  rather than re-reading the marker grammar in shell. A record set it cannot read
  is `pending`, never red — a transient comments-API failure must not fail the
  required status — and a record whose author the collaborators permission API
  does not confirm as a writer is ignored, exactly as `codex-review.yml`'s
  adjudication ledger ignores it, so the gate never blocks on a record that holds
  no downgrade power. One consequence to know: readiness has **no
  `issue_comment` trigger**, so correcting the offending comment fires nothing by
  itself. `pr-readiness-sweep.yml` mode 5 covers that — it treats a disposition
  record whose `updated_at` is newer than the verdict as evidence the verdict is
  stale, and re-fires the recompute within ~15 minutes. Deleting the record with
  no replacement leaves nothing observable and waits for a push or a manual
  dispatch. The comparison is not race-free and is not claimed to be: the gate
  reads the comments early in the readiness job while the status is published at
  the end, so a record created in between is missed by that run and also looks
  older than the verdict to the sweep. What bounds that residual is the harm
  model, not the detection -- a violating record's only power is letting the
  adjudication ledger downgrade a REPEATED finding on a later review round, and a
  later review round takes a push, which recomputes readiness and catches the
  violation.
- **Unapproved fork runs remain blocking but are attributed separately.** GitHub
  reports a fork workflow held behind *Approve and run* as `action_required`
  even though it has not executed. Readiness keeps the failure status and
  `readiness: action required` label, but lists those lanes under **Awaiting
  maintainer approval** instead of **Blocking**. It does not call them pending:
  only a maintainer can clear the condition, while pending statuses are eligible
  for automatic self-healing.

Two subtleties:

- **It refreshes while a workflow is re-running, but not when one starts.** It triggers
  on `workflow_run` `in_progress` and `completed`, not on `requested`. `in_progress` is a
  merge guard, not a cosmetic: it is the only type that sees a monitored workflow go back
  to running, because a re-run reuses the same run and increments its attempt instead of
  creating a new one. Without it, a re-run of an already-green lane would leave readiness
  publishing the pre-re-run `success` for the whole re-run -- and since that status is the
  branch-protection handle for the entire fan-out, armed auto-merge could merge a revision
  whose lane is failing at that moment. `requested` is the type that carries nothing: it
  fires at run CREATION, when no lane can have a verdict yet and readiness has already
  published `checking` from the `pull_request_target` path. Since every type fires once per
  monitored workflow per revision, listing all three dispatched up to 42 readiness runs per
  head update and made readiness ~67% of every workflow run this repository created; two
  types put the ceiling at 28. The `pr+sha` concurrency group collapses the burst for
  execution, but a collapsed run has already consumed its dispatch slot, so the group does
  not bound that cost.
- **A `pull_request_target` run gets its own isolated concurrency group.** Those are
  the only readiness runs that surface as a CheckRun in the PR's rollup, and GitHub
  marks any superseded run "cancelled" whichever way `cancel-in-progress` is set, so
  sharing a cancelling group would show a spurious cancelled check on the PR even
  though the authoritative commit status is fine. Un-collapsed runs on superseded
  revisions simply no-op green, because the evaluate and publish steps are idempotent
  and stale-SHA guarded. The `workflow_run` and `workflow_dispatch` runs do not appear
  in the rollup, so they keep the cheap per-`(pr, sha)` burst collapse.
- **The pending sentinel is conditional.** A `pull_request_target` open/synchronize
  run is meant to surface a transient "checking" signal, but it can be
  runner-queue-delayed past the `workflow_run` runs that already published the
  terminal verdict for the same SHA. Adding the sentinel unconditionally would then
  clobber a decided verdict back to `checking` with no further event left to
  recompute it on an unchanged commit, freezing the status at pending indefinitely.
  So it is added only when the live evaluation still found something genuinely
  incomplete.
- **A transport error during evaluation is non-terminal.** Every read-only `gh`
  call goes through a bounded retry helper (3 attempts with backoff, 120s cap per
  attempt); a non-429 HTTP 4xx is treated as permanent misconfiguration and fails
  the job loudly instead of retrying. If an **evaluation** read still fails after
  the retries, the evaluate step publishes an explicit non-terminal "could not be
  evaluated" verdict (`pending` under `readiness: checking`) instead of exiting
  non-zero — so a transient network/TLS blip during evaluation never leaves a red
  check-run or skips the publish step (issue #2753: the same commit evaluated
  green then red 39 seconds apart). Exhausted retries in the other steps (context
  resolution, closed-PR label cleanup, the publish step's own reads) still fail
  the job — only the evaluation loop has the non-terminal branch. This does not
  weaken the gate: `pending` blocks merge exactly like `failure`, and only a
  transport error with no already-observed blocker takes that branch (a genuine
  failure recorded by an earlier lane dominates and the verdict stays the
  terminal red `action required`, with a summary note that the evaluation was
  truncated). Recovery is automatic — the self-heal sweep re-fires stale pending
  statuses, and any later monitored-workflow event recomputes sooner. A truncated
  run defers (publishes nothing) only when the revision already carries a
  **blocking** verdict — the merge is already held and pending would only discard
  the red's diagnostics. Every other prior state publishes pending: an existing
  *success* is re-pended (a rerun means validation state is unknown again, and a
  stale green left mergeable is the unsafe direction — pending can only ever
  block, never allow), and an unreadable verdict state gets the same fail-safe
  treatment. The status
  POST itself is never retried: commit statuses are last-write-wins with no
  conditional write, so any retry races a concurrent run's newer verdict — a
  failed POST fails the step loud and a re-run republishes. The label writes
  keep only the narrow 404/already-exists race tolerance they already have.
- **Nothing keys off `workflow_run.pull_requests`.** That array is empty whenever the
  head repository is a fork, the same GitHub behaviour the `fork-*` workflows already
  work around. The job gate admits every `pull_request` and `dynamic` run and lets the
  head SHA resolve to a PR via `repos/:repo/commits/:sha/pulls`, and a monitored run is
  bound back to the PR by `(head_repository.full_name, head_branch)` on top of the
  `head_sha=` query — a pair that is populated on a fork run, and unique because only
  one open PR can exist per source repository + branch. Keying either place on the PR
  number froze a fork PR at pending forever: the gate skipped every re-evaluation, so
  the verdict was whatever the `pull_request_target` run saw *before* the monitored
  workflows existed, and the lookup independently reported already-green workflows as
  `(not started)`.

## Fork PRs

A fork PR gets no repository OIDC credentials or secrets, and this repository's
managed CodeQL workflow is not scheduled for fork heads. Two consequences.

**A fork PR can still reach `readiness: passed`.** The `fork-*` pipeline below runs
the AI reviews from the trusted base branch and posts them as check-runs under the
same names the same-repo lanes use, so `pr-readiness.yml` evaluates a fork from
those check-runs and a fully green fork is fully validated. That read is **bound to
the lane's `external_id`**, which carries the PR number plus the triggering run id
and attempt (`<lane>-pr-<PR>-<run>-<attempt>`), not the check-run name alone: two
open PRs can share a head SHA and each posts a check-run under this same name, and a
rerun on an unchanged head leaves the previous attempt's row in place, so a
name-only read could let a sibling PR's clean verdict — or a stale previous-attempt
row — answer for this PR. Readiness derives the expected id from the newest run of
the triggering workflow (`Fast Gate`); when no matching row exists yet the lane
reads as pending, which holds the merge rather than borrowing an answer. A
human-override rerun (`gh api .../runs/<id>/rerun`) re-executes a lane's run
directly without Fast Gate re-running, so the trigger-bound id stays identical
between the stale failed attempt and the fresh rerun -- readiness resolves that by
collapsing every check-run sharing an id to the newest by check-run id (distinct per
POST, monotonically increasing), so the fresh rerun always wins. `pr-readiness.yml`
also triggers on that same rerun's own `workflow_run: in_progress` event, which
fires the instant the rerun starts and can race the rerun's own "Open check-run"
step -- reading check-runs at that exact moment would still see only the OLD
completed verdict. Readiness recognizes when its own evaluation was triggered by
that lane's `in_progress` event (by name and status on the triggering
`workflow_run`) and reads pending directly, without querying check-runs at all;
the rerun's own completion re-triggers a real evaluation. CodeQL is
the single ineligible lane, reported as a non-blocking "Not eligible" note rather
than a blocker. Readiness therefore says the same thing on a fork as anywhere else: the
eligible automated validation passed for this revision. Human approval and branch
protection remain separate gates.

**The `fork-*` pipeline gives fork PRs AI review anyway, in two stages.**
`fork-opus-review.yml`, `fork-gpt-review.yml`, `fork-design-review.yml`,
`fork-ux-review.yml`, `fork-first-principles-review.yml` and
`fork-security-scope-review.yml` each trigger on the
**completion of `Fast Gate`** (stage 1) and run privileged from the default branch
(stage 2), gated on
`workflow_run.head_repository.full_name != github.repository`. Each posts a check-run
named exactly like its same-repo twin (`Opus 4.8 Review`, `GPT 5.6 Review`,
`Design Review`, `UX Review`, `First Principles Review`, `Security Scope Review`),
so branch protection is
satisfied on either path, and it opens that check-run as early as possible keyed to
`head_sha` so a job that dies still leaves a fail-closed result.

Stage 1 is `Fast Gate` rather than `CI` because what stage 2 needs from stage 1 is a
TRUSTED workflow's word on the head commit, and `Fast Gate` gives that in about a
minute where `CI` took ~54. That is a latency change, not a trust change: the
security properties below hold whatever stage 1 is, since none of them depend on
`CI` having gone green. `CI`'s verdict was a quality precondition here, never a
security one — and `fork-workflow-guard.yml`, which IS a security lane, still keys on
`CI` and is unaffected.

On a fork PR this lane is the **only** publisher of that name -- the same-repo twin
renames itself (see the reviewer-job security posture above) -- so the protected
status can only be reported by a review that actually ran.

`fork-gpt-review.yml` publishes its GPT verdict by editing one marker comment in
place, so an incomplete run must never bury a posted verdict (the class of bug tracked
as #8292). It goes further than a preserve-and-prepend approach: an incomplete run never
modifies an existing comment at all. Overlapping runs for different SHAs can read the
comment before a newer run publishes its verdict, so an incomplete run that read verdict
V1 first must not PATCH V1 back over a newer run's V2 that landed in between -- and even
a PATCH that only preserved the verdict and prepended a notice would restore that stale
body. So when an existing bot comment is present, an incomplete run leaves it entirely
untouched (a diagnostic log line only), whether or not it carries a `[GPT-REVIEWED]`
verdict. Completed and blocked verdicts still replace the comment as before, and the
fail-closed `Finalize check-run` step is unchanged, so an incomplete run is never
mistaken for an approval and merge safety is unaffected.

Nothing the fork controls can influence these reviews:

- `workflow_run` **always** runs the workflow definition from the **default branch**,
  so a fork editing these files in its PR has no effect on what runs.
- `github.event.workflow_run.head_sha` is set by GitHub and is the only authoritative
  input taken from the trigger. The PR is resolved by matching an open PR whose head
  SHA equals it, because `workflow_run.pull_requests` is empty for forks.
- The base SHA is re-fetched from the PR via the API and the diff is re-derived from
  GitHub's compare endpoint pinned to `(base_sha...head_sha)`. Stage 1's artifact is
  an untrusted **hint** only, so a fork faking it changes nothing.
- The fork's code is only **read** (the trusted base tree plus the authentic diff as
  a data file), never built, installed or executed.
- `step-security/harden-runner` with `egress-policy: block` and a narrow endpoint
  allowlist, plus short-lived Bedrock-only OIDC credentials, bound the blast radius
  of any prompt injection. That allowlist is coupled to the reviewer's own setup, not
  just to the model call: `allowed_non_write_users` auto-enables the action's
  bubblewrap isolation, which the action bootstraps over apt, so the ubuntu archive
  hosts are load-bearing. Remove them and the install exits before any model call --
  the blocking lane then goes red, and an **advisory** lane publishes `review
  incomplete` as a *neutral* check, which is how three reviewers can stop reviewing
  every fork PR without turning anything red (#12099). The endpoints for both that
  bootstrap and the bun release asset are pinned by tests in
  `test/test_ai_review_workflows.py`, because a `workflow_run` lane always executes
  the default branch's yaml and so cannot exercise its own change pre-merge.

**`fork-workflow-guard.yml`** blocks a fork PR that modifies anything under
`.github/**`, the vector a fork would use to fake basic-CI results (rewrite `ci.yml`
to pass) or tamper with CODEOWNERS. It is deterministic on purpose: "does the diff
touch `.github/**`" is a file-path check, so a grep on the authentic changed-file
list is completely reliable, instant and free, where a model gate would be slower,
cost money and could hallucinate. It runs from the default branch (via `workflow_run`
of CI, plus `pull_request_target` for the override-label re-evaluation), so a fork
cannot disable it, and a fork's own `pull_request` runs have no `checks: write` to
forge its verdict. A maintainer who has reviewed a legitimate workflow change applies
the `allow-fork-workflow-change` label and the guard re-evaluates green; the label is
stripped on a new revision, so the override cannot carry over.

One class of file under `.github/**` is exempt: the ratchet baselines
(`.github/coverage-baselines/*.txt` and `.github/*-baseline.txt`). They are plain
data consumed by gates that run from the trusted base workflow, so a fork editing one
cannot run code or forge a check-run -- the worst it can do is loosen its own ratchet,
which is a visible line in the diff that CODEOWNERS review already covers. A fork PR
that adds a file, or shrinks a baselined one, has to edit these to pass the coverage
and lint gates, so guarding them blocked every such contribution for nothing. The
exemption is an exact-shape allowlist (a `.txt` leaf directly under
`coverage-baselines/`, or a top-level `*-baseline.txt`), not a directory prefix, so
`.github/coverage-baselines/x/evil.yml` or `.github/workflows/foo-baseline.txt` are
still caught.

## `dependency-vulnerability.yml`: the production npm gate

Every publication runs one blocking production-dependency control in
`.github/workflows/dependency-vulnerability.yml`. It deliberately does NOT run per pull request: the
audit reaches the npm registry, whose slow hours made it the one red X on otherwise-green PRs
(re-run by hand until it passed) — and a gate people learn to re-run until green is not a gate. It
runs where a vulnerable dependency would actually ship, so nothing vulnerable is published, and a PR
that adds or bumps a dependency is checked by the release or nightly that would carry it.

The two callers hang it off different layers on purpose:

- **`release.yml`** — the release wheel and desktop builds depend directly on the gate, so all
  publish, sign, and GitHub Release jobs are transitively unreachable when it fails.
- **`nightly.yml`** — every job that ships bytes to a nightly-channel user (`publish-cli`, the six
  `publish-linux-*` callers, `publish-windows-x64`, `publish-docker`, `sign-and-notarize`) depends on
  the gate; no build job does. main has no dependency gate of its own, so without this a
  high/critical production vulnerability landing on main shipped to nightly users unaudited until
  the next tagged release. Gating the builds instead is what once failed the nightly for hours at a
  stretch — hanging it off publication means a slow registry delays publishing an already-built
  nightly, and a re-run publishes the same artifacts once the audit answers.
  `test_dependency_vulnerability_gate.py` pins both halves: every publish job gated, no build job
  gated.

The gate audits all lockfile-backed Node applications independently:

- `website/package-lock.json`
- `website/electron/package-lock.json`
- `site/package-lock.json`

CI pins Node `24.19.0`, then invokes the exact npm package `npm@10.8.2` through `npx` with
`audit --omit=dev --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --audit-level=high --json`. It neither
installs project packages nor runs project lifecycle scripts. High and critical production
findings block; information, low, moderate, and development-only findings do not.

**Transient-failure contract.** The audit is an idempotent read, so a stall or connection fault is
retried rather than failed on the first try. The pinned npm is resolved once up front
(`npx --yes npm@10.8.2 --version`, verified to print exactly the pinned version) so the download a
cold runner pays is never charged against an audit's own timeout. Each attempt is bounded by
`AUDIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (180s); an attempt that times out, raises a subprocess error, or exits with
a status other than npm's documented audit results 0/1 **and** carries one of npm's connection-level
markers on stderr (`ETIMEDOUT`, `ECONNRESET`, `EAI_AGAIN`, `E503`, ... — `TRANSIENT_STDERR_MARKERS`)
is retried up to `AUDIT_ATTEMPTS` (3) times with a short backoff. Every attempt of every audit in a
run draws on one shared wall-clock budget (`AUDIT_TOTAL_BUDGET_SECONDS`, 720s, under the job's 15-minute ceiling): no attempt gets
more than the time left, and no retry starts unless the budget still holds its backoff plus a full
attempt's ceiling, so retries cannot outgrow the job's own `timeout-minutes`. Exit 0/1 are never treated as transient
whatever stderr says (1 is the audit answering "vulnerable"), and every other failure below is
definitive and never retried. Exhausting the attempts or the budget fails closed, naming the attempt
count so a persistent registry outage reads as one rather than as a flaky gate.

**Fail-closed contract.** A missing `npx`, missing manifest or lockfile, a warm-up that does not
yield the pinned npm, a transient failure that outlives the retries or the budget, a non-transient
subprocess error, an exit status other than npm's documented audit-result statuses 0/1, empty or
malformed JSON, npm
`error` response, unsupported audit report version, inconsistent counts/status, broken advisory
reference, or high/critical record without a stable advisory identity fails the job. Exit 1 is
accepted only with a structurally valid report that contains high/critical findings. String `via`
references are recursively resolved to leaf advisories, cycles and missing references are errors,
and findings are deduplicated by lockfile, affected package, and advisory. npm registry/advisory
availability is consequently an explicit release dependency: an outage blocks rather than skips
the control.

**Exception contract.** `.vulnerability-exceptions.json` is validated before any audit against the
contract represented by `.vulnerability-exceptions.schema.json` and the stricter date checks in
the gate. The root has exactly `version: 1` and `exceptions`; each exception has exactly:

| Field | Contract |
|-------|----------|
| `package` | Exact npm package name; wildcards are forbidden. |
| `advisory` | Exact canonical `GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` or fallback `npm:<numeric source>` identity. |
| `paths` | One or more exact audited lockfile paths from the list above; no duplicates. |
| `reason` | Trimmed 20–500 character risk justification and mitigation. |
| `owner` | Accountable GitHub `@user` or `@org/team`. |
| `expires` | Real ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` date, no more than 30 days ahead at validation time. |

An exception matches only the package + advisory + lockfile tuple; it cannot suppress another
package, advisory, or project. Duplicate scopes, unknown fields, unsupported paths, malformed
identifiers, or an expiry more than 30 days ahead invalidate the complete file. An expiry date is
valid through that UTC date; beginning the next UTC day, the stale entry fails the entire gate even
if its advisory is no longer reported. Renewal requires a reviewed edit that moves the date back
within the 30-day window and confirms the owner, reason, and mitigation remain current. Remove an
entry as soon as the dependency is fixed; Git history is the approval record.

Run the same control from the repository root with:

```bash
python scripts/check_npm_audit.py
```

The command contacts npm's registry/advisory service. Unit tests mock the subprocess boundary and
cover malformed output, operational failures, report resolution, schema constraints, expiry, and
exact-match exception behavior without network access.

## AI-review human overrides: the authorization rules

The command grammar and the marker contract are in [Human override](#human-override); this section states the authorization and freshness rules the handler enforces.

Human judgment is the final authority over the Fable 5 and GPT 5.6
AI-review results. A repository member with `write`, `maintain`, or `admin`
permission can record a false-positive, not-applicable, or accepted-risk
decision with:

```text
/ai-review override <fable|gpt|design|ux|first-principles|scope|all> <current-sha>: <reason>
```

The decision is intentionally explicit and commit-scoped. The handler resolves
the current PR head and accepts a 7–40-character SHA prefix only when it matches
that head; the trusted record stores the full SHA. Any subsequent push therefore
invalidates the decision and causes normal AI review on the new commit.

**Trust boundary** — `.github/workflows/ai-review-human-override.yml` runs on
`issue_comment`, so GitHub loads it from the default branch. It never checks out
or executes PR-controlled code. Before changing a result it requires:

1. The exact command shape above and a non-empty, at-most-500-character reason.
2. A current-head SHA match.
3. The commenter to have `write`, `maintain`, or `admin` collaborator
   permission. PR authors receive no exemption.

After validation it posts a `github-actions[bot]` comment whose hidden marker
binds `{target, full head SHA, actor, source comment id}`. Reviewer workflows
trust only this bot-authored marker; a raw author or third-party comment cannot
turn a gate green. The handler has only review-control permissions
(`actions:write`, `checks:write`, `pull-requests:write`, and
`contents:read`), and receives no `id-token` or `contents:write`.
`pull-requests:write` is required for the handler to create the trusted record
on a pull request; `issues:write` alone does not make that write reliable for a
GitHub Actions installation token.

For Fable 5 and GPT 5.6, the handler re-runs the existing PR workflow. The
re-run resolves the trusted marker before acquiring AWS credentials, skips the
model invocation, updates the existing summary with a human-override banner,
and exits its original gate successfully. Either event ordering — an override
recorded before a reviewer starts, or one arriving during model execution —
leaves the SHA-scoped human decision authoritative.

The marker-keyed comments expose the override command to repository
writers. GPT 5.6 also normalizes each current-commit result into a
top verdict plus one sentence: `✅ no blocking findings`,
`🔴 changes requested (blocking)`, an incomplete state, or a human-override
state, so a green verdict from the previous commit is never left looking
current.

When no current-SHA override is active, GPT 5.6 injects a bounded
ADJUDICATION LEDGER into the review prompt: the bot-authored override
records, plus the marker and finding-title lines of review-disposition
comments whose authors' current collaborator permission is `write`,
`maintain`, or `admin` (verified per login against the collaborators
permission API — the same check the override handler applies to its actor).
Prior review bodies are never injected. The ledger is nonce-delimited,
capped at 6,000 bytes, and explicitly untrusted data: it can downgrade the
repetition of an adjudicated finding class to advisory, and it can never
waive a new defect or authorize a green verdict.

GPT makes exactly two model calls. Pass 1 discovers candidates across the
full diff; pass 2 attempts to falsify each candidate and emits the only
verdict exposed to the comment and gate. Pass 2 also drops or downgrades a
candidate whose proposed fix violates the FIX BAR, a BLOCKING candidate that
cannot be anchored to an AUTOSDE rule or residual defect class, and a
relocated variant of a ledger-adjudicated class; an adjudication goes stale
for lines the current head materially changed. A prior disposition never
hides a currently provable new defect. Any failed call makes the review
incomplete and leaves no current-SHA reviewed marker, so the gate fails
closed.

## Readiness: what the aggregate does and does not mask

The job's inputs and outputs are in [`pr-readiness.yml`: the aggregator](#pr-readinessyml-the-aggregator); this section states the masking guarantees.

`.github/workflows/pr-readiness.yml` publishes one current-revision answer for
the repository's fan-out of CI and AI reviews. The commit status context is
`PR Readiness`; the PR carries exactly one matching managed label:
`readiness: checking`, `readiness: action required`, or `readiness: passed`.
The workflow creates missing labels idempotently, replaces the prior readiness
label, and removes readiness labels when the PR closes. A passed label means
the automated lanes passed for that SHA; it does not represent human approval.
Making `PR Readiness` a required status remains an explicit branch-protection
or ruleset setting outside the workflow.

The aggregate covers the latest PR run for CI, Build,
Code Review, Opus 4.8 Review, GPT 5.6 Review (the reconciled result of its three
calls), Security Scope Review, and Design Review. For managed CodeQL it requires
both the dynamic analysis workflow and the exact-head `CodeQL` security result
published by the
`github-advanced-security` app. This preserves failures from an Analyze job and
also prevents a successful analysis workflow from masking alert-driven failure.
Default setup can publish a neutral interim result before every configured
language reports; that state remains `checking` and the existing stale-pending
sweep requests another evaluation if no workflow event follows the final result.
Fork PRs cannot receive repository secrets or
OIDC credentials, and this repository's managed default-setup CodeQL workflow
is not scheduled for fork heads. The secret-backed AI reviews therefore run for
forks from the trusted base branch via the `fork-*` pipeline and are graded from
the head SHA's check-runs, leaving CodeQL as the only lane explicitly ineligible
for a fork. Missing or running eligible lanes
produce `checking`; blocking workflow/check failures produce
`action required`; drafts remain `checking`.
Design Review completion is required, but its verdict and
infrastructure conclusion are advisory. It emits one `PASS | CONCERNS | BLOCK`
verdict and no separate blast-radius rating, and it owns the long-term
reversibility (one-way-door) lens. Mergeability, behind-base state,
and human review decisions are not part of this event-driven aggregate because
they can change without an aggregate refresh event; branch protection and the
live `prepare-pr` status check own them.

Every event resolves the PR's current head through the GitHub API. An event
carrying an older expected SHA is ignored, so a late
run cannot relabel the new revision. A code-free `pull_request_target` handler
updates same-repository and fork PRs from the trusted base workflow. Actions
that start or restart validation for the same SHA, including a PR description
edit that re-runs Code Review, force the aggregate to `checking` before run
lookup so an older successful same-SHA run cannot keep readiness green. Trusted
base-repository `workflow_run` events refresh it as eligible lanes finish,
including the `fork-*` reviewer completions that carry a fork's verdicts.
Readiness-label events cannot recursively rerun or cancel a review: ignored label
events use a per-run concurrency key, so they cannot cancel an
active review or replace a pending authoritative reviewer event.

The bundled `prepare-pr` skill owns the local pre-push procedure. It resolves
read-only reviewers and gates from the base-ref profile, extracts each reviewer's
own CI contract, and binds publication to the verifier-cleared SHA. AI-comment
repair delegation follows [Agent repair routing](#agent-repair-routing), not a
replacement of that profile. Dispositions retain the prior judged SHA, finding
identity and evidence; they never carry a human override onto a new head.

`prepare-pr/scripts/pr_status.py` folds the aggregate status in as one signal,
never an override of the rows: its FAILURE blocks and its PENDING waits, but its
green does not clear an observed failing or pending duplicate check in GitHub's
rollup, because the aggregate's `context` is a forgeable display string a status
publisher on the pull request can set. Older PRs without the aggregate retain the
fail-closed legacy rollup behavior. Only the commit-status `context` named
`PR Readiness` is read as the aggregate; a same-named CheckRun cannot mask
another failure. Unresolved review threads are reported for visibility but are
advisory rather than an automatic readiness failure.

## Over-engineering resistance

AI-native coding skews toward over-engineering, and a naive AI reviewer compounds it
by demanding still more mechanisms, which produces unending review loops. Every layer
resists this:

- **Both line reviewers share an identical FIX BAR:** every finding must carry a fix
  expressible as an edit to lines **this PR changed**. If the fix would need a new
  function, module, abstraction, config knob, dependency, or an edit to untouched
  code, it is out of scope for the bot. GPT 5.6 drops such a finding; Opus 4.8
  **demotes it to advisory instead of dropping it** -- the author cannot land the
  remedy in this PR, so it must not gate the merge, but the signal is real and a
  human decides. A regression the diff itself introduces still blocks either way,
  since reverting the hunk is an in-diff fix. **The absence of a
  mechanism is never a finding.** This makes "add mechanism X" structurally
  un-reportable: the demand fails the bar before it can become a finding. A scope cap
  complements it: Opus 4.8 stays within the evident scope of the diff (it is code-only),
  and GPT 5.6 stays within the PR's stated purpose, flagging a
  description-versus-diff mismatch as an **advisory** finding rather than a block.
- **The WHAT BLOCKS list is closed:** exhaustive, never extended, never reasoned about
  by analogy, with no "and other serious issues" clause. A finding blocks only if it
  is a `blocking: true` AUTOSDE-rule violation on a changed file (or this PR
  weakening such a rule), or a **reachable and concrete** residual-class defect: a
  security hole with a named trigger, a crash or data loss or corruption on a path
  this diff changes, or a removed guard with no compensating replacement. Style,
  naming, speculative performance and hypotheticals never block.
- **Design and UX suggestions must be proportionate,** and Design carries the
  simpler-alternative ethos: actively flag when a materially simpler solution exists,
  but always advisory.
- **`prepare-pr`'s severity gate closes the loop:** validate each finding's
  legitimacy first, fix the true Critical and High ones, **rebut a false positive with
  evidence rather than appeasing it by changing correct code**, and defer the low ones.
  Combined with the single-commit rule and description reconciliation, that keeps a PR
  converging on its stated purpose instead of accreting scope round over round.

The net effect: expensive or irreversible risk blocks, and everything else is advice a
human can take or defer. "More mechanism" is deliberately not a demand that can block.
